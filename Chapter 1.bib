   abstract = {Intensive agriculture can result in increased runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals that pollute streams. Consensus is emerging that, despite our best efforts, it is unlikely that significant reductions in nutrient loading to surface waters will be achieved through traditional, in-field management alone. Riparian forest buffers can play an important role in the movement of water and NPS (non-point source) pollutants to surface water bodies and ground water. Riparian buffers are linear in nature and because of their position in the landscape provide effective connections between the upland and aquatic ecosystems. Present designs tend to use one model with a zone of unmanaged trees nearest the stream followed by a zone of managed trees with a zone of grasses adjacent to the crop field. Numerous variations of that design using trees, shrubs, native grasses and forbs or nonnative cool-season grasses may provide better function for riparian forest buffers in specific settings. Properly designed riparian buffers have been shown to effectively reduce surface NPS pollutant movement to streams and under the right geological riparian setting can also remove them from the groundwater. Flexibility in design can also be used to produce various market and nonmarket goods. Design flexibility should become more widely practiced in the application of this agroforestry practice.},

   abstract = {Applications of Hutchinson's n-dimensional niche concept are often focused on the role of interspecific competition in shaping species distribution patterns. In this paper, I discuss a variety of factors, in addition to competition, that influence the observed relationship between species distribution and the availability of suitable habitat. In particular, I show that Hutchinson's niche concept can be modified to incorporate the influences of niche width, habitat availability and dispersal, as well as interspecific competition per se. I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions.},

   abstract = {The growing human population concentrated in urban areas lead to the increase of road traffic and artificial areas, consequently enhancing air pollution and urban heat island effects, among others. These environmental changes affect citizen's health, causing a high number of premature deaths, with considerable social and economic costs. Nature-based solutions are essential to ameliorate those impacts in urban areas. While the mere presence of urban green spaces is pointed as an overarching solution, the relative importance of specific vegetation structure, composition and management to improve the ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation are overlooked. This avoids the establishment of optimized planning and management procedures for urban green spaces with high spatial resolution and detail. Our aim was to understand the relative contribution of vegetation structure, composition and management for the provision of ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation in urban green spaces, in particular the case of urban parks. This work was done in a large urban park with different types of vegetation surrounded by urban areas. As indicators of microclimatic effects and of air pollution levels we selected different metrics: lichen diversity and pollutants accumulation in lichens. Among lichen diversity, functional traits related to nutrient and water requirements were used as surrogates of the capacity of vegetation to filter air pollution and to regulate climate, and provide air purification and climate regulation ecosystem services, respectively. This was also obtained with very high spatial resolution which allows detailed spatial planning for optimization of ecosystem services. We found that vegetation type characterized by a more complex structure (trees, shrubs and herbaceous layers) and by the absence of management (pruning, irrigation and fertilization) had a higher capacity to provide the ecosystems services of air purification and climate regulation. By contrast, lawns, which have a less complex structure and are highly managed, were associated to a lower capacity to provide these services. Tree plantations showed an intermediate effect between the other two types of vegetation. Thus, vegetation structure, composition and management are important to optimize green spaces capacity to purify air and regulate climate. Taking this into account green spaces can be managed at high spatial resolutions to optimize these ecosystem services in urban areas and contribute to improve human well-being.},

   abstract = {Key recent developments in litter decomposition research are reviewed. Long-term inter-site experiments indicate that temperature and moisture influence early rates of litter decomposition primarily by determining the plants present, suggesting that climate change effects will be small unless they alter the plant forms present. Thresholds may exist at which single factors control decay rate. Litter decomposes faster where the litter type naturally occurs. Elevated CO2 concentrations have little effect on litter decomposition rates. Plant tissues are not decay-resistant; it is microbial and biochemical transformations of materials into novel recalcitrant compounds rather than selective preservation of recalcitrant compounds that creates stable organic matter. Altering single characteristics of litter will not substantially alter decomposition rates. Nitrogen addition frequently leads to greater stabilization into humus through a combination of chemical reactions and enzyme inhibition. To sequester more C in soil, we need to consider not how to slow decomposition, but rather how to divert more litter into humus through microbial and chemical reactions rather than allowing it to decompose. The optimal strategy is to have litter transformed into humic substances and then chemically or physically protected in mineral soil. Adding N through fertilization and N-fixing plants is a feasible means of stimulating humification. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The profiles thus obtained are obviously related to niche concepts in the Grinnell tradition, and separated from those in Elton's tradition. I argue that it is useful to define Grinnellian and Eltonian niches on the basis of the types of variables used to calculate them, the natural spatial scale at which they can be measured, and the dispersal of the individuals over the environment. I use set theory notation and analogies derived from population ecology theory to obtain formal definitions of areas of distribution and several types of niches.

However, we know little about the relative and combined effects of above-and belowground biodiversity on multiple ecosystem functions (for example, ecosystem multifunctionality, EMF) or how climate might mediate those relationships. Here we tease apart the effects of biotic and abiotic factors, both above-and belowground, on EMF on the Tibetan Plateau, China. We found that a suite of biotic and abiotic variables account for up to 86% of the variation in EMF, with the combined effects of above-and belowground biodiversity accounting for 45% of the variation in EMF. Our results have two important implications: first, including belowground biodiversity in models can improve the ability to explain and predict EMF. Second, regional-scale variation in climate, and perhaps climate change, can determine, or at least modify, the effects of biodiversity on EMF in natural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The objective of the present study was to evaluate soil microbial community function and diversity among eight single and mixed species forest ecosystems (18-year-old restoration) in subtropical China. Materials and methods: Soil samples of the 0-10 cm depth were taken from each of the eight forest ecosystems: Masson pine (CP1); Pitch pine (CP2); Slash pine and Sweetgum (CBMP1); Slash pine and Camphortree (CBMP2); Masson pine and Sweetgum and Chinese Gugertree (CBMP3); Sweetgum and Chinese Gugertree (BMP); Chinese Gugertree (BP1); and Sweetgum (BP2). Potential soil bacterial catabolic activities were assessed by the MicroResp™, and bacterial and fungal community diversities were analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. Results and discussion: Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) rates and catabolic evenness of the SIR values for 15 carbon (C) sources under the broadleaved forest ecosystems (BP2, BMP, BP1) were much higher than those under the mixed conifer-broadleaved forest ecosystem (CBMP1 and CBMP2), and then under the pure conifer forest ecosystems (CP2 and CP1). Value of Shannon-Weaver index in the MicroResp™ was similar to that in the DGGE method, but the value of evenness was lower than that in the DGGE method. Principal component analysis, using all 15 C sources in the MicroResp™, 39 bands of fungi and 21 main bands of bacteria in the DGGE profiles, revealed a separation of all the soil samples, indicating that they had different patterns of potential C utilization and different microbial communities. The scores of the first principal component appeared to reflect the variation of soil microbial functional and structural communities associated with different forest ecosystems. Conclusions: Results from this study showed that forest ecosystems have significantly influenced the composition and function of soil microbial community. Catabolic diversity and function of soil microbial community under broadleaf tree species and mixed broadleaf-conifer plant species are much better than under conifer tree species. This may indicate that the efficiency of soil quality restoration is higher under broadleaf species than under coniferous species. Further study is needed for investigating the consequences of the changes seen in this study on soil microbial functional diversity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

The studies include: (a) forest ecosystem services; (b) forests and water; (c) forests and energy; and (d) the sustainable consumption and production of forest products. Executive Summary The world's forest ecosystems provide critical and diverse services and values to human society. As primary habitat for a wide range of species, forests support biodiversity maintenance and conservation. Forest growth sequesters and stores carbon from the atmosphere, contributing to regulation of the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Healthy forest ecosystems produce and conserve soil and stabilize stream flows and water runoff-preventing land degradation and desertification, and reducing the risks of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and landslides. Forests also serve as sites of aesthetic, recreational, and spiritual value in many cultural and societal contexts, and contribute to poverty eradication and economic development by providing food, fiber, timber, and other forest products for subsistence and income generation.},

The biological transformation of exudates into microbial metabolites and necromass is a major source of soil organic matter (SOM), including persistent mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). Recent recognition of the fundamental importance of these inputs from living roots for sustaining life belowground and replenishing SOM demands a rethinking of how we harvest forests. By severing the lifeline of living roots, clearcut harvesting devastates much of the belowground biodiversity in forests, and prohibits a principal pathway through which SOM and C stocks are replenished. Retention harvesting retains the influence of living roots within retention patches and potentially throughout the harvested area, but only if inter-tree distances are 15 m or less. Retention trees sustain and support the re-establishment of belowground life and function following forest harvest and may mitigate post-harvest soil C losses. Sustaining the belowground ecosystem via inputs from living roots is an underappreciated benefit of continuous-cover and retention forestry.},

Here we evaluate whether the spatial autocorrelation underlying species data affects accuracy-statistics and map the uncertainties due to spatial autocorrelation effects on species range predictions under past and future climate models. As an example, ENMs were fitted to Qualea grandiflora (Vochysiaceae), a widely distributed plant from Brazilian Cerrado. We corrected for spatial autocorrelation in ENMs by selecting sampling sites equidistant in geographical (GEO) and environmental (ENV) spaces. Distributions were modelled using 13 ENMs evaluated by two accuracy-statistics (TSS and AUC), which were compared with uncorrected ENMs. Null models and the similarity statistics I were used to evaluate the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Moreover, we applied a hierarchical ANOVA to partition and map the uncertainties from the time (across last glacial maximum, pre-insustrial, and 2080 time periods) and methodological components (ENMs and autocorrelation corrections). The GEO and ENV models had the highest accuracy-statistics values, although only the ENV model had values higher than expected by chance alone for most of the 13 ENMs. Uncertainties from time component were higher in the core region of the Brazilian Cerrado where Q. grandiflora occurs, whereas methodological components presented higher uncertainties in the extreme northern and southern regions of South America (i.e. outside of Brazilian Cerrado). Our findings show that accounting for autocorrelation in environmental space is more efficient than doing so in geographical space. Methodological uncertainties were concentrated in outside the core region of Q. grandiflora's habitat. Conversely, uncertainty due to time component in the Brazilian Cerrado reveals that ENMs were able to capture climate change effects on Q. grandiflora distributions. © 2014 The Authors.},

Models were trained with over 800,000 points of known presence and absence. Using 11 climate scenarios for the decade around 2060, we classified and mapped change for each species. Projected impacts are extensive. Except for the low-elevation woodland species, persistent habitat is rare. Most habitat is lost or threatened and is poorly compensated by emergent habitat. Three species may be locally extirpated. Nevertheless, strategies are described that can use the projections to apply management where it is likely to be most effective, to facilitate or assist migration, to favor species likely to be suited in the future, and to identify potential climate refugia.},

   abstract = {The niche concept is central to ecology but is often depicted descriptively through observing associations between organisms and habitats. Here, we argue for the importance of mechanistically modelling niches based on functional traits of organisms and explore the possibilities for achieving this through the integration of three theoretical frameworks: Biophysical ecology (BE), the geometric framework for nutrition (GF) and dynamic energy budget (DEB) models. These three frameworks are fundamentally based on the conservation laws of thermodynamics, describing energy and mass balance at the level of the individual and capturing the prodigious predictive power of the concepts of 'homeostasis' and 'evolutionary fitness'. BE and the GF provide mechanistic multi-dimensional depictions of climatic and nutritional niches, respectively, providing a foundation for linking organismal traits (morphology, physiology, behaviour) with habitat characteristics. In turn, they provide driving inputs and cost functions for mass/energy allocation within the individual as determined by DEB models.We show how integration of the three frameworks permits calculation of activity constraints, vital rates (survival, development, growth, reproduction) and ultimately population growth rates and species distributions. When integrated with contemporary niche theory, functional trait niche models hold great promise for tackling major questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

Many hybridizing species have porous genomes with regions impermeable to introgression, conferring reproductive barriers between species. We used ecological niche modelling to study the glacial and postglacial recolonization patterns between the widely hybridizing spruce species Picea glauca and P. engelmannii in western North America. Genome-wide estimates of admixture based on a panel of 311 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 290 genes were used to assess levels of admixture and introgression and to identify loci putatively involved in adaptive differences or reproductive barriers between species. Our palaeoclimatic modelling suggests that these two closely related species have a long history of hybridization and introgression, dating to at least 21 000 years ago, yet species integrity is maintained by a combination of strong environmental selection and reduced current interspecific gene flow. Twenty loci showed evidence of divergent selection, including six loci that were both Fst outliers and associated with climatic gradients, and fourteen loci that were either outliers or showed associations with climate. These included genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction and transcription factors. © 2014 The Authors. Molecular Ecology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

However, it is seldom used to test the extent that modelled HS-scores (probability of species occurrence) can represent on-the-ground measures of species-structural characteristics. In this study, we compare four parametric and non-parametric models generated with the R-package, sdm, to assess the potential for these models to estimate tree species distribution of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] in naturally-growing forests across an extensive landscape. Central to this development are inventory plot data of species presence-absence and four abiotic factors linked to plant growth and distribution. The study's abiotic factors include: (1) photosynthetically active radiation; (2) growing degree-days; (3) relative extractable soil water content; and (4) near-surface wind speed, all expressed spatially at 30-m resolution. To gauge whether modelled HS can explain structural characteristics in balsam fir-dominated stands, field-based estimates of site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG) were compared against independently-derived HS-scores. The results showed that: (i) random forest was the most successful at representing species distribution of balsam fir among the four methods considered; (ii) overall growing conditions for balsam fir was observed to be most favourable on north-facing slopes, particularly in the northwest part of the target landscape, where near-surface air temperatures are cooler, soils are moderately wetter, and wind speeds are lower; (iii) tree-based calculations of SI were partially characterised by patterns in modelled HS-scores, due to scale differences (i.e., from individual tree to 30-m grid cells) and an inadequate number of sample trees; and (iv) patterns of cumulative AGB were more accurately represented by species HS. Modelled HS-scores, as potential indicators of tree species habitat preference, AGB, and species distribution, can offer key ecological information essential to inform forest management and conservation planning at the landscape level.},

   abstract = {Modeling of the ecological niche of vegetal species is useful for understanding the species-environment relationship, for prediction of responses to climate changes and for correct reforestation programs and establishment of plantation’s recommendation. The objective of this work was to establish a model for the distribution of four tree species (Casearia sylvestris, Copaifera langsdorffii, Croton floribundus and Tapirira guianensis), widely used in reforestation projects in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between environmental characteristics and the occurrence of species and tested the performance of Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks as modeling methods. These methods were evaluated by their overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Kappa, true skill statistic and the area under the receiver operating curve. The results showed the species Casearia sylvestris, Copaifera langsdorffii and Tapirira guianensis widely occurring in the state of Minas Gerais, including a broad range of environmental variables. Croton floribundus had restricted occurrence in the southern state, showing narrow environmental variation. The resulting algorithms demonstrated greater performance when modeling restricted geographic and environmental species, as well as species occurring with high prevalence in data. The algorithm Random Forest performed better for distribution modeling of all species, although the results varied for each metric and species. The maps generated had acceptable metrics and are supported by and ecological information obtained from other sources, constituting a useful tool to understand the ecology and biogeography of the target species.},

   abstract = {Aim Climate change has the potential to have significant impacts on the distribution of species and on the composition of habitats. This paper identifies the potential changes in the future distribution of species under the UKCIP98 climate change scenarios, in order that such changes can be taken into account in conservation management. Location The model was applied to Britain and Ireland. Methods A model based on an artificial neural network was used to predict the changing bioclimate envelopes of species in Britain and Ireland. Fifty-four species representing 15 habitats were modelled. Results The modelled species could be placed into three categories: those losing suitable climate space, those gaining it, and those showing little or no change. When the species were associated with habitats it was found that Arctic-Alpine/montane heath communities were the most sensitive to climate change, followed by pine woodland and beech woodland in southern England. In lowland heath, wet heath, cereal field margins, coastal grazing marsh, drought-prone acid grassland and calcareous grassland, the species either showed little change or an increase in suitable climate space. The other eight habitats showed a mixed response. Conclusions The species show a variety of responses to climate change and thus their current habitat associations may alter. The uncertain future of some species and habitats is highlighted. Conservation policy and practice will need to be revised in the face of climate change.},

Environmental differences between the location of origin and the planting (test) site have been calculated by principal component analysis and termed ecological distance, Based on ecological distance values, the growth response of tree populations can be modeled as a function of the test site macroclimate. These models can then be used to predict the effects of climatic change on growth and survival.

   abstract = {Numerous studies have reported that treelines are moving to higher elevations and higher latitudes. Most treelines are temperature limited and warmer climate expands the area in which trees are capable of growing. Hence, climate change has been assumed to be the main driver behind this treeline movement. The latest review of treeline studies was published in 2009 by Harsch et al. Since then, a plethora of papers have been published studying local treeline migration. Here we bring together this knowledge through a review of 142 treeline related publications, including 477 study locations. We summarize the information known about factors limiting tree-growth at and near treelines. Treeline migration is not only dependent on favorable growing conditions but also requires seedling establishment and survival above the current treeline. These conditions appear to have become favorable at many locations, particularly so in recent years. The review revealed that at 66% of these treeline sites forest cover had increased in elevational or latitudinal extent. The physical form of treelines influences how likely they are to migrate and can be used as an indicator when predicting future treeline movements. Our analysis also revealed that while a greater percentage of elevational treelines are moving, the latitudinal treelines are capable of moving at greater horizontal speed. This can potentially have substantial impacts on ecosystem carbon storage. To conclude the review, we present the three main hypotheses as to whether ecosystem carbon budgets will be reduced, increased or remain the same due to treeline migration. While the answer still remains under debate, we believe that all three hypotheses are likely to apply depending on the encroached ecosystem. Concerningly, evidence is emerging on how treeline migration may turn tundra landscapes from net sinks to net sources of carbon dioxide in the future.},

To compensate for increased salivation during sedation, which would enable an accelerated flux of applied virus to the gastrointestinal tract, we injected intraveneously an anti-<:holinergic glycopyrroniumbromide just before virus inoculation. For atraumatic exposure of the palatine and lingual tonsils, a cotton-wool swab was saturated with phosphate-buffered saline, squeezed out, and then saturated with an undiluted or 1 :10 diluted cell-free virus suspension. Thereafter, these tonsillar regions were repeatedly touched lightly in three 5-min intervals with freshly saturated swabs, finally applying a total volume of-SO to 80 µl of virus suspension. This applied amount of virus was calculated by weighing the swabs after use and corresponded to-2000 to 3000 TCID 50 with undiluted virus \{which corresponds to amounts used in many studies of urethral, rectal. and vaginal transmission) and-200 to 300 TCID 50 with the diluted virus. At the time of inoculation, no obvious lesions or gingivitis were observed in the oral cavity of any of the animals used. To monitor long-tenm infection by this route, we followed three macaques, two receiving undiluted virus and one 1: 10 diluted virus, for a longer period of time. To determine the site of virus entry and virus spread, we euthanisized another eight monkeys in the acute phase after tonsillar exposure, two each on days 2, 3, and 4 and one each on days 7 and 23 after inoculation. Tonsillar infection was compared with the iv route by infecting other animals intravenously with a similar dose of 2000 TCID 50 of the same virus stock and monitoring them with virologic assays for several weeks and by histology in one animal on day 4. At necropsy lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs were sampled from various body locations for virus isolation, histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. 20. Cell-associated viral loads were detenmined by limiting dilution coculture with mononuclear cells from blood and lymphoid organs \{35). PBMCs were separated from whole citrated blood by Ficoll density gradient centrif-ugation. To prepare mononuclear cells from lymphoid organs (tonsils, lymph nodes from different regions, spleen, thymus, and Peyer's patches), we forced the respective tissues through commercial nylon sieves (100-µm mesh, Falcon) and processed them like PBMCs except for the density gradient centrifugation. This cen-trifugation step was only necessary for spleen cells because of the red blood cell contamination. After separation of mononuclear cells, they were simultaneously cocultivated in declining concentrations with human CBl-66 T cells as indicators (35). Cultures were monitored for syncytia formation, and intracellular an-tigen was visualized by an immunoperoxidase assay \{36), with the modification that the T cells were adhered to concanavalin A-<:oated microtitre plates instead of poly-L-lysine-<oated plates. All treated cells were scored under a light microscope, with infected cells being identified by a deep red-brown cytoplasmic staining. The endpoint of the viral load was calculated as described (35, 37\}. Heat-inactivated whole SIV lysate was used in optimal concentrations to coat 96-well microtiter plates to measure serum anti-SIV antibody responses as described \{36). Antigenemia was measured by a commercial HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen test (lnno-genetics, Zwijndrecht, Belgium). To detenmine the absolute CD4 + T cell counts in blood, we stained PBMCs with phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody to CD4 \{OKT 4, Ortho Diagnostics Systems) and analyzed them on an EPICS XL flow cytometer \{Coulter) with gating on lym-phocytes. CD4 + T cell numbers were calculated by multiplying white cell count times lymphocyte percentage in a blood smear times CD4 + T cell percentage by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). 21. C. Stahl-Hennig et al., data not shown. 22. The 5-µm-thick paraffin or cryostat sections were placed on slides coated with 3-amino-propyl-trietho-silane. Four sections from each tissue per time point were hybridized with an 35 5-labeled, single-stranded, antisense RNA probe of 51Vmac239 \{Lofstrand Labs, Gaithersburg, MD). It was composed of fragments of 1.4 to 2. 7 kb in size, which collectively represent-90% of the SIV genome. As a positive control, cytospin prepartions of SIV-infected PBMCs were REPORTS hybridized, and as a negative control, a sense-strand probe was used. Dewaxed paraffin sections were boiled in a domestic pressure cooker in citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 5 min, chilled down to room temperature, rinsed in water containing 2% diethyl-pyrocarbonate, and prehybridized for 2 hours at 45°C. The prehy-bridization mixture consisted of 50% formamide, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM tris-HCI at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Ficoll-polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 2 mg of tRNA per milliliter. Prehybridization was followed by incubation with the hybridization mixture (prehybridiza-tion mixture, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 x 10 6 dpm of probe per milliliter) overnight at 45°C in a moist chamber. After several washings in standard saline citrate \{SSC\}, the sections were digested with ribo-nuclease at 37°C for 40 min, washed again in 2 X SSC, dehydrated, and dipped in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion.},

On patchy compared with continuous serpentine, alpha diversity (local) was 32% lower, gamma diversity (total) was 17% higher, and beta diversity (differentiation in species composition among sites) was 72% higher. Of the increased beta diversity on patches, most (62%) occurred at the 'local' scale of patches 50-3200 m apart, and only 10% occurred at the scale of clusters of patches 16-45 km apart. Complementarity, an alternative measure of beta diversity, showed the same patterns. Woody plants on nonserpentine soils showed diversity patterns similar to those on patchy serpentine, i.e., lower alpha and higher beta and gamma diversity relative to continuous serpentine. Nonserpentine plants showed a stronger response to environmental gradients than did serpentine plants. For the woody plant community, on serpentine soils, the natural large-scale patchiness of the habitat leads to lower local diversity but higher differentiation and regional diversity. The increased regional diversity appears to be almost entirely the result of edge effects, rather than of 'patchy coexistence' as described by metacommunity models.},

   abstract = {Intraspecific variation plays a critical role in extant and future forest responses to climate change. Forest tree species with wide climatic niches rely on the intraspecific variation resulting from genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to accommodate spatial and temporal climate variability. A centuries-old legacy of forest ecological genetics and provenance trials has provided a strong foundation upon which to continue building on this knowledge, which is critical to maintain climate-adapted forests. Our overall objective is to understand forest trees intraspecific responses to climate across species and biomes, while our specific objectives are to describe ecological genetics models used to build our foundational knowledge, summarize modeling approaches that have expanded the traditional toolset, and extensively review the literature from 1994 to 2021 to highlight the main contributions of this legacy and the new analyzes of provenance trials. We reviewed 103 studies comprising at least three common gardens, which covered 58 forest tree species, 28 of them with range-wide studies. Although studies using provenance trial data cover mostly commercially important forest tree species from temperate and boreal biomes, this synthesis provides a global overview of forest tree species adaptation to climate. We found that evidence for genetic adaptation to local climate is commonly present in the species studied (79%), being more common in conifers (87.5%) than in broadleaf species (67%). In 57% of the species, clines in fitness-related traits were associated with temperature variables, in 14% of the species with precipitation, and in 25% of the species with both. Evidence of adaptation lags was found in 50% of the species with range-wide studies. We conclude that ecological genetics models and analysis of provenance trial data provide excellent insights on intraspecific genetic variation, whereas the role and limits of phenotypic plasticity, which will likely determine the fate of extant forests, is vastly understudied.},

   abstract = {Knowledge about the local adaptation and response of forest tree populations to the climate is important for assessing the impact of climate change and developing adaptive genetic resource management strategies. However, such information is not available for most plant species. Here, based on 69 provenances tested at 19 common garden experimental sites, we developed a universal response function (URF) for tree height at seven years of age for the important and wide-spread native Chinese tree species Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco. URF was recently used to predict the potential growth response of a population originating from any climate and growing in any climate conditions. The developed model integrated both genetic and environmental effects, and explained 55% of the total variation in tree height observed among provenances and test sites in China. We found that local provenances performed better than non-local counterparts in habitats located in central, eastern, and southwestern China, showing the evidence of local adaptation as compared to other regions. In contrast, non-local provenances outperformed local ones in peripheral areas in northern and northwestern China, suggesting an adaptational lag in these areas. Future projections suggest that the suitable habitat areas of P. orientalis would expand by 15%-39% and shift northward by 0.8-3 degrees in latitude; however, the projected tree height of this species would decline by 4%-8% if local provenances were used. If optimal provenances were used, tree height growth could be improved by 13%-15%, along with 59%-71% suitable habitat expansion. Thus, assisted migration with properly selected seed sources would be effective in avoiding maladaptation in new plantations under a changing climate for P. orientalis.},

   abstract = {Climate is a major environmental factor affecting the phenotype of trees and is also a critical agent of natural selection that has molded among-population genetic variation. Population response functions describe the environmental effect of planting site climates on the performance of a single population, whereas transfer functions describe among-population genetic variation molded by natural selection for climate. Although these approaches are widely used to predict the responses of trees to climate change, both have limitations. We present a novel approach that integrates both genetic and environmental effects into a single "universal response function" (URF) to better predict the influence of climate on phenotypes. Using a large lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) field transplant experiment composed of 140 populations planted on 62 sites to demonstrate the methodology, we show that the URF makes full use of data from provenance trials to: (1) improve predictions of climate change impacts on phenotypes; (2) reduce the size and cost of future provenance trials without compromising predictive power; (3) more fully exploit existing, less comprehensive provenance tests; (4) quantify and compare environmental and genetic effects of climate on population performance; and (5) predict the performance of any population growing in any climate. Finally, we discuss how the last attribute allows the URF to be used as a mechanistic model to predict population and species ranges for the future and to guide assisted migration of seed for reforestation, restoration, or afforestation and genetic conservation in a changing climate. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Identifying populations within tree species potentially adapted to future climatic conditions is an important requirement for reforestation and assisted migration programmes. Such populations can be identified either by empirical response functions based on correlations of quantitative traits with climate variables or by climate envelope models that compare the climate of seed sources and potential growing areas. In the present study, we analyzed the intraspecific variation in climate growth response of Douglas-fir planted within the non-analogous climate conditions of Central and continental Europe. With data from 50 common garden trials, we developed Universal Response Functions (URF) for tree height and mean basal area and compared the growth performance of the selected best performing populations with that of populations identified through a climate envelope approach. Climate variables of the trial location were found to be stronger predictors of growth performance than climate variables of the population origin. Although the precipitation regime of the population sources varied strongly none of the precipitation related climate variables of population origin was found to be significant within the models. Overall, the URFs explained more than 88% of variation in growth performance. Populations identified by the URF models originate from western Cascades and coastal areas of Washington and Oregon and show significantly higher growth performance than populations identified by the climate envelope approach under both current and climate change scenarios. The URFs predict decreasing growth performance at low and middle elevations of the case study area, but increasing growth performance on high elevation sites. Our analysis suggests that population recommendations based on empirical approaches should be preferred and population selections by climate envelope models without considering climatic constrains of growth performance should be carefully appraised before transferring populations to planting locations with novel or dissimilar climate.

   abstract = {Locally adapted temperate tree populations exhibit genetic trade-offs among climate-related traits that can be exacerbated by selective breeding and are challenging to manage under climate change. To inform climatically adaptive forest management, we investigated the genetic architecture and impacts of selective breeding on four climate-related traits in 105 natural and 20 selectively bred lodge-pole pine populations from western Canada. Growth, cold injury, growth initiation, and growth cessation phenotypes were tested for associations with 18,600 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in natural populations to identify "positive effect alleles" (PEAs). The effects of artificial selection for faster growth on the frequency of PEAs associated with each trait were quantified in breeding populations from different climates. Substantial shifts in PEA proportions and frequencies were observed across many loci after two generations of selective breeding for height, and responses of phenology-associated PEAs differed strongly among climatic regions. Extensive genetic overlap was evident among traits. Alleles most strongly associated with greater height were often associated with greater cold injury and delayed phenology, although it is unclear whether potential trade-offs arose directly from pleiotropy or indirectly via genetic linkage. Modest variation in multilocus PEA frequencies among populations was associated with large phenotypic differences and strong climatic gradients, providing support for assisted gene flow polices. Relationships among genotypes, phenotypes, and climate in natural populations were maintained or strengthened by selective breeding. However, future adaptive phenotypes and assisted gene flow may be compromised if selective breeding further increases the PEA frequencies of SNPs involved in adaptive trade-offs among climate-related traits. climatic adaptation | selective breeding | lodgepole pine | positive effect alleles | polygenic traits L ocal adaptation of climate-related traits in widespread temperate conifers has been demonstrated for centuries using extensive long-term common garden experiments (1, 2). As early as the 17th century, foresters were instructed to recognize variation in desirable traits and select seed from trees with favorable phenotypes (3). Modern tree improvement programs systematically select upon genetic variation, primarily to achieve growth gains and meet economic objectives. Estimates of genetic variation and gains from selection made using quantitative genetic models assume many anonymous loci of small effect underlie both variation in continuously distributed phenotypes and their responses to selective breeding. However, the type, quantity, effect size, distribution , and dynamics of genes underlying locally adaptive pheno-typic variation and responses to selective breeding in forest trees are still poorly understood (4). Directional selection over hundreds or thousands of generations has led to genomic features of domestication in agricultural crops including simplified genetic architectures underlying many traits, reduced genome-wide diversity, and numerous selective sweeps (5-7). Beyond high-gain, short-rotation clonal forestry [e.g., Eu-calyptus spp. (8)], we know little about the effects of artificial selection on adaptive genetic variation in forest trees, yet many tree species undergo some degree of selective breeding. Two or three generations of conifer breeding is not expected to have the same magnitude of genetic effects seen in domesticated crops, but if artificial selection for increased productivity is detectable in conifer genomes, it may expose genetic relationships and potential sources of trade-offs between growth and climatically adaptive phenotypes. Climate-related adaptive traits are often intercorrelated due to pleiotropy, natural selection, or linkage disequilibrium (LD), so that strong directional selection on one trait can cause correlated responses in others. Pleiotropic allelic variants associated with phenotypes do not function in isolation. Antagonistic pleiotropic effects among traits can generate adaptive trade-offs among traits within populations, and limit gains from selection on a focal trait (9). Trait-trait correlations can also arise through strong selection acting in parallel on unlinked loci or from LD mediated by physical linkage of loci on chromosomes. Average genome-wide LD estimates in conifers appear to be low (10, 11) Significance Temperate trees originating from warmer localities usually grow faster and acclimate to winter later than trees of the same species from colder localities. However, when trees are selected for faster growth, are climatically adaptive genes and traits affected? Our research demonstrates a simple, sensitive, broadly applicable, and elusive approach to integrating complex polygenic variation into applied environmental management. We show that selective breeding increases allele frequencies of many trait-associated genes, and that alleles that increase most display strong genetic linkage and potential trade-offs among traits. Increasing tree growth while maintaining adaptation is essential to reforestation in a changing climate, but this may be challenging because trait-associated genetic variation that underpins climate adaptation is responsive to selection for tree growth.

   abstract = {1. Large differences exist in the predictions of plant responses to climate change among models that consider population variation and those that do not. Models that treat species as homogeneous entities typically predict net positive impacts of climate change on temperate forest productivity, while most studies that consider adaptive genetic variation within species conclude that the impacts of climate change on forest productivity will be negative. 2. We present a modelling approach that predicts plant responses to climate change using both ecological and genetic variables. The model uses growth data from multi-site provenance trials together with climate data for provenance source locations and test sites to predict distribution and productivity of tree populations under climate change. We used an extensive lodgepole pine Pinus contorta provenance data set to illustrate the model. 3. Spatially explicit predictions of the impacts of climate change on production were developed and suggested that different populations of lodgepole pine will respond very differently to climate change. Large production losses will be seen in many areas, although modest production increases may occur in some areas by 2085. The model further projects a significant redistribution of the species' potential habitat northwards and upwards in altitude over the next several decades. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study points to the need to consider population differences when modelling biotic responses to climate change, and suggests that climate change will render populations maladapted in many areas. The model also provides a key tool potentially to mitigate climate change impacts by identifying populations expected to be best adapted throughout the next generation of forests. Finally, the study highlights the value of wide-ranging long-term provenance tests in addressing key issues in ecology and climate change. © 2008 The Authors.},

A pesar de ser una disciplina relativamente joven, los fundamentos conceptuales clásicos de la restauración parecen actualmente poco prácticos considerando los grandes retos generados por modificación y destrucción de ecosistemas a causa de actividades antrópicas (deforestación, cambio de uso de suelo, contaminación) y el cambio climático global. En el concepto clásico de restauración se pretende recuperar el ecosistema degradado a las mismas condiciones de un referente histórico. Sin embargo, hoy parece poco viable que los ecosistemas vuelvan a un estado previo a las perturbaciones, porque ya se han superado los umbrales de resiliencia. Adicionalmente, el cambio climático está modificando el ambiente a una velocidad sin precedentes. Por tal razón, la restauración ecológica necesita unir esfuerzos de diversos actores para la recuperación de ecosistemas que puedan ser sustentables y funcionales a futuro, donde las especies sean capaces de tolerar las condiciones ambientales que existirán a largo plazo. Como una estrategia de conservación de especies se ha propuesto la migración asistida, que es la translocación de especies a nuevas localidades fuera de su rango de distribución conocido. En el contexto actual de pérdida de diversidad y de ecosistemas, esta estrategia podría ser fundamental para la conformación de nuevas comunidades que luego pueden convertirse en nuevos ecosistemas, donde puedan persistir especies fundamentales para la dinámica de los ecosistemas y, al mismo tiempo, se recupere función, estructura y resiliencia.},

Con-currently, the mission of protected areas has expanded from biodiversity conservation to improving human welfare. The result is a shift in favor of protected areas allowing local resource use. Given the multiple purposes of many protected areas, measuring effectiveness is difficult. Our review of 49 tropical protected areas shows that parks are generally effective at curtailing deforestation within their boundaries. But deforestation in surrounding areas is isolating protected areas. Many initiatives now aim to link protected areas to local socioeconomic development. Some of these initiatives have been successful, but in general expectations need to be tempered regarding the capacity of protected areas to alleviate poverty. Greater attention must also be paid to the broader policy context of biodiversity loss, poverty, and unsustainable land use in developing countries. Copyright © 2005 by Annual Reviews.

   abstract = {The genetic background of transplants used to create or augment wild populations may affect the long-term success of restored populations. If seed sources are from differently adapted populations, then the relative performance of progeny from crosses among populations may decrease with an increase in genetic differences of parents and in the differences of parental environments to the transplant location. We evaluated the potential for such outbreeding depression by hybridizing individuals from six different populations of Lotus scoparius var. scoparius and L. s. var. brevialatus. We used allozyme data to calculate genetic distances between source populations, and compiled climatic data and measured soil traits to estimate environmental distances between source populations. We found significant outbreeding depression following controlled crosses. In the greenhouse, the success of crosses (seeds/flower X seedlings/seed) decreased with increasing genetic distance between populations revealing genetically based outbreeding depression unrelated to local adaptation. After outplanting to one native site (in situ common garden), field cumulative fitness of progeny (survival X fruit production) decreased significantly with mean environmental distance of the parental populations to the transplant site, but not with genetic distance between the crossed populations. This result is consistent with a disruption of local adaptation. At the second, ecologically contrasting common garden, where low survival reduced statistical power, field cumulative fitness (survival X progeny height) did not decrease significantly with either environmental distance or genetic distance. Overall, intervariety crosses were 40 and 50% as fit (seeds/flower X seedlings/seed X survival X fruits at the first garden or X height at the second) as intravariety crosses. These results suggest that the cumulative outbreeding depression was caused by a combination of genetically based ecological differences among populations and other genomic coadaptation. We conclude that mixing genetically differentiated seed sources of Lotus scoparius may significantly lower the fitness of augmented or restored populations. Genetic and environmental similarities of source populations relative to the transplant site should be considered when choosing source materials, a practice recommended by recent seed transfer policies. Geographic separation was not a good surrogate for either of these measures.},

Warmer and drier conditions particularly facilitate fire, drought and insect disturbances, while warmer and wetter conditions increase disturbances from wind and pathogens. Widespread interactions between agents are likely to amplify disturbances, while indirect climate effects such as vegetation changes can dampen long-term disturbance sensitivities to climate.

   abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

   abstract = {Climate change predictions derived from coupled carbon-climate models are highly dependent on assumptions about feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere. One critical feedback occurs if C uptake by the biosphere increases in response to the fossil-fuel driven increase in atmospheric [CO 2] (''CO2 fertiliza-tion''), thereby slowing the rate of increase in atmospheric [CO 2]. Carbon exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere are often first represented in models as net primary productivity (NPP). However, the contribution of CO 2 fertilization to the future global C cycle has been uncertain, especially in forest ecosystems that dominate global NPP, and models that include a feedback between terrestrial biosphere metabolism and atmospheric [CO 2] are poorly constrained by experimental evidence. We analyzed the response of NPP to elevated CO 2 (550 ppm) in four free-air CO 2 enrichment experiments in forest stands. We show that the response of forest NPP to elevated [CO 2] is highly conserved across a broad range of productivity, with a stimulation at the median of 23 2%. At low leaf area indices, a large portion of the response was attributable to increased light absorption, but as leaf area indices increased, the response to elevated [CO 2] was wholly caused by increased light-use efficiency. The surprising consistency of response across diverse sites provides a benchmark to evaluate predictions of ecosystem and global models and allows us now to focus on unresolved questions about carbon partitioning and retention, and spatial variation in NPP response caused by availability of other growth limiting resources. CO2 fertilization global change leaf area index net primary productivity A nalysis and prediction of the effects of human activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, on climate and the biological, physical, and social responses to changing climate require an integrated view of the complex interactions between the biosphere and atmosphere. Carbon cycle models are now being coupled to atmosphere-ocean general circulation climate models to achieve a dynamic analysis of the relationships between C emissions, atmospheric chemistry, biosphere activity, and climatic change (1-3). Exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere are represented in models using empirical and theoretical expressions of net primary productivity (NPP), the net fixation of C by green plants into organic matter, or the difference between photosynthesis and plant respiration. Because the photosynthetic uptake of carbon that drives NPP is not saturated at current atmospheric concentrations (4), NPP should increase as fossil-fuel combustion adds to the atmospheric [CO 2 ]. Increased C uptake into the biosphere in response to rising [CO 2 ] (''CO 2 fertilization'') can create a negative feedback that slows the rate of increase in atmospheric [CO 2 ] (3, 5). Hence, assumptions regarding CO 2 fertilization of the terrestrial biosphere greatly affect predictions of future atmospheric [CO 2 ] (3). The response of NPP to [CO 2 ] in models can be prescribed (1) or calculated through a mechanistic representation (3, 5). In either case, the predicted responses of net ecosystem production (or NPP minus heterotrophic respiration), net C exchange with the atmosphere, and the climatic responses to atmospheric [CO 2 ] will be incorrect if the magnitude of the CO 2 fertilization effect is not represented accurately. Experimental data should provide useful guidance to models, thereby increasing our confidence in model predictions. Experiments have unequivocally shown that plants can grow faster and larger in a CO 2-enriched atmosphere (6-8), and the mechanisms of response are well understood (4). The relevance of this evidence to prediction of global C budgets over decadal time frames, however, may be limited. As spatial and temporal scales increase beyond what can be captured in experiments, modifying influences of resource availability and biogeochemical feedbacks within the ecosystem become increasingly important, and these tend to diminish the simple response to elevated [CO 2 ] observed in small-scale experiments. The problem is especially severe with forests because of the inherent difficulty in conducting relevant experiments at appropriate spatial and temporal scales with large and long-lived organisms and complex ecosystems. Nevertheless , the potential responses of forests to rising [CO 2 ] cannot be ignored in global C cycling analyses and predictions of climatic change because forest ecosystems contribute 50% of global NPP and 80% of terrestrial NPP (9). With the development of Free-Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) technology (10, 11), it is now possible to elevate atmospheric [CO 2 ] in large plots in intact forest ecosystems without altering other microclimatic and biotic variables (12). Recognizing that the results from any single experiment may not be broadly representative, here we provide the an analysis of NPP data from the four FACE experiments operating in forest stands.

   abstract = {The most common tool to predict future changes in species range are species distribution models. These models do, however, often underestimate potential future habitat, as they do not account for phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation, although being the most important processes in the response of tree populations to rapid climate change. Here, we quantify the difference in the predictions of future range for Norway spruce, by (i) deriving a classic, occurrence-based species distribution model (OccurrenceSDM), and (ii) analysing the variation in juvenile tree height and translating this to species occurrence (TraitSDM). Making use of 32 site locations of the most comprehensive European trial series that includes 1,100 provenances of Norway spruce originating from its natural and further beyond from its largely extended, artificial distribution, we fit a universal response function to quantify growth as a function of site and provenance climate. Both the OccurrenceSDM and TraitSDM show a substantial retreat towards the northern latitudes and higher elevations (−55 and −43%, respectively, by the 2080s). However, thanks to the species’ particularly high phenotypic plasticity in juvenile height growth, the decline is delayed. The TraitSDM identifies increasing summer heat paired with decreasing water availability as the main climatic variable that restricts growth, while a prolonged frost-free period enables a longer period of active growth and therefore increasing growth potential within the restricted, remaining area. Clear signals of local adaptation to climatic clines spanning the entire range are barely detectable, as they are disguised by a latitudinal cline. This cline strongly reflects population differentiation for the Baltic domain, but fails to capture the high phenotypic variation associated to the geographic heterogeneity in the Central European mountain ranges paired with the species history of postglacial migration. Still the model is used to provide recommendations of optimal provenance choice for future climate conditions. In essence, assisted migration may not decrease the predicted range decline of Norway spruce, but may help to capitalize on potential opportunities for increased growth associated with warmer climates.},

   abstract = {Climate change over the past ,30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species 1,2 and has been implicated in one species-level extinction 3. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (,18%) than mid-range (,24%) and maximum-change (,35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration. The responsiveness of species to recent 1-3 and past 4,5 climate change raises the possibility that anthropogenic climate change could act as a major cause of extinctions in the near future, with the Earth set to become warmer than at any period in the past 1-40 Myr (ref. 6). Here we use projections of the future distributions of 1,103 animal and plant species to provide 'first-pass' estimates of extinction probabilities associated with climate change scenarios for 2050. For each species we use the modelled association between current climates (such as temperature, precipitation and seasonality) and present-day distributions to estimate current distributional areas 7-12. This 'climate envelope' represents the conditions under which populations of a species currently persist in the face of competitors and natural enemies. Future distributions are estimated by assuming that current envelopes are retained and can be projected for future climate scenarios 7-12. We assume that a species either has no limits to dispersal such that its future distribution becomes the entire area projected by the climate envelope model or that it is incapable of dispersal, in which case the new distribution is the overlap between current and future potential distributions (for example, species with little dispersal or that inhabit fragmented landscapes) 11. Reality for most species is likely to fall between these extremes. We explore three methods to estimate extinction, based on the species-area relationship, which is a well-established empirical power-law relationship describing how the number of species relates to area (S ¼ cA z , where S is the number of species, A is area, and c and z are constants) 13. This relationship predicts adequately the numbers of species that become extinct or threatened when the area available to them is reduced by habitat destruction 14,15. Extinctions arising from area reductions should apply regardless of whether the cause of distribution loss is habitat destruction or climatic unsuitability. Because climate change can affect the distributional area of each species independently, classical community-level approaches need to be modified (see Methods). In method 1 we use changes in the summed distribution areas of all species. This is consistent with the traditional species-area approach: on average, the destruction of half of a habitat results in the loss of half of the distribution area summed across all species restricted to that habitat. However, this analysis tends to be weighted towards species with large distribu-tional areas. To address this, in method 2 we use the average proportional loss of the distribution area of each species to estimate the fraction of species predicted to become extinct. This approach is faithful to the species-area relationship because halving the habitat area leads on average to the proportional loss of half the distribution of each species. Method 3 considers the extinction risk of each species in turn. In classical applications of the species-area approach, the fraction of species predicted to become extinct is equivalent to the mean probability of extinction per species. Thus, in method 3 we estimate the extinction risk of each species separately by substituting its area loss in the species-area relationship, before averaging across species (see Methods). Our conclusions are not dependent on which of these methods is used. We use z ¼ 0.25 in the species-area relationship throughout, given its previous success in predicting proportions of threatened species 14,15 , but our qualitative conclusions are not dependent on choice of z (Supplementary Information). As there are gaps in the data (not all dispersal/climate scenarios were available for each region), a logit-linear model is fitted to the extinction risk data to produce estimates for missing values in the extinction risk table (Table 1). Balanced estimates of extinction risk, averaged across all data sets, can then be calculated for each scenario. For projections of maximum expected climate change, we estimate species-level extinction across species included in the study to be 21-32% (range of the three methods) with universal dispersal, and 38-52% for no dispersal (Table 1). For projections of mid-range climate change, estimates are 15-20% with dispersal and 26-37% without dispersal (Table 1). Estimates for minimum expected climate change are 9-13% extinction with dispersal and 22-31% without dispersal. Projected extinction varies between parts of the world and between taxonomic groups (Table 1), so our estimates are affected by the data available. The species-area methods differ from one another by up to 1.41-fold (method 1 versus method 3) in estimated extinction, whereas the two dispersal scenarios produce a 1.98-fold difference, and the three climate scenarios generate 2.05-fold variation. letters to nature NATURE | VOL 427 | 8 JANUARY 2004 | www.nature.com/nature 145},

   abstract = {Geographic variation in trees has been investigated since the mid-18th century. Similar patterns of clinal variation have been observed along latitudinal and elevational gradients in common garden experiments for many temperate and boreal species. These studies convinced forest managers that a 'local is best' seed source policy was usually safest for reforestation. In recent decades, experimental design, phenotyping methods, climatic data and statistical analyses have improved greatly and refined but not radically changed knowledge of clines. The maintenance of local adaptation despite high gene flow suggests selection for local adaptation to climate is strong. Concerns over maladaptation resulting from climate change have motivated many new genecological and population genomics studies; however, few jurisdictions have implemented assisted gene flow (AGF), the translocation of pre-adapted individuals to facilitate adaptation of planted forests to climate change. Here, we provide evidence that temperate tree species show clines along climatic gradients sufficiently similar for average patterns or climate models to guide AGF in the absence of species-specific knowledge. Composite provenancing of multiple seed sources can be used to increase diversity and buffer against future climate uncertainty. New knowledge will continue to refine and improve AGF as climates warm further.},

   abstract = {Projected climate warming will potentially have profound effects on the earth's biota, including a large redistribution of tree species. We developed models to evaluate potential shifts for 80 individual tree species in the eastern United States. First, environmental factors associated with current ranges of tree species were assessed using geographic information systems (GIS) in conjunction with regression tree analysis (RTA). The method was then extended to better understand the potential of species to survive and/or migrate under a changed climate. We collected, summarized, and analyzed data for climate, soils, land use, elevation, and species assemblages for >2100 counties east of the 100th meridian. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data for >100 000 forested plots in the East provided the tree species range and abundance information for the trees. RTA was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution as well as predict the future potential distributions under two scenarios of climate change with twofold increases in the level of atmospheric CO2. Validation measures prove the utility of the RTA modeling approach for mapping current tree importance values across large areas, leading to increased confidence in the predictions of potential future species distributions. With our analysis of potential effects, we show that roughly 30 species could expand their range and/or weighted importance at least 10%, while an additional 30 species could decrease by at least 10%, following equilibrium after a changed climate. Depending on the global change scenario used, 4-9 species would potentially move out of the United States to the north. Nearly half of the species assessed (36 out of 80) showed the potential for the ecological optima to shift at least 100 km to the north, including seven that could move >250 km. Given these potential future distributions, actual species redistributions will be controlled by migration rates possible through fragmented landscapes.},

Because many modern trees display adaptive differentiation in relation to latitude or elevation, it is likely that ancient trees were also so differentiated, with environmental sensitivities of populations throughout the range evolving in conjunction with migrations. Rapid climate changes challenge this process by imposing stronger selection and by distancing populations from environments to which they are adapted. The unprecedented rates of climate changes anticipated to occur in the future, coupled with land use changes that impede gene flow, can be expected to disrupt the interplay of adaptation and migration, likely affecting productivity and threatening the persistence of many species. Modem plant tax.a have persisted through a long period of variable climate, including glacial-interglacial cycles with large changes in temperature, precipitation, and CO 2 concentration , over the past 2.5 million years.

   abstract = {The most common tool to predict future changes in species range are species distribution models. These models do, however, often underestimate potential future habitat, as they do not account for phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation, although being the most important processes in the response of tree populations to rapid climate change. Here, we quantify the difference in the predictions of future range for Norway spruce, by (i) deriving a classic, occurrence-based species distribution model (OccurrenceSDM), and (ii) analysing the variation in juvenile tree height and translating this to species occurrence (TraitSDM). Making use of 32 site locations of the most comprehensive European trial series that includes 1,100 provenances of Norway spruce originating from its natural and further beyond from its largely extended, artificial distribution, we fit a universal response function to quantify growth as a function of site and provenance climate. Both the OccurrenceSDM and TraitSDM show a substantial retreat towards the northern latitudes and higher elevations (−55 and −43%, respectively, by the 2080s). However, thanks to the species’ particularly high phenotypic plasticity in juvenile height growth, the decline is delayed. The TraitSDM identifies increasing summer heat paired with decreasing water availability as the main climatic variable that restricts growth, while a prolonged frost-free period enables a longer period of active growth and therefore increasing growth potential within the restricted, remaining area. Clear signals of local adaptation to climatic clines spanning the entire range are barely detectable, as they are disguised by a latitudinal cline. This cline strongly reflects population differentiation for the Baltic domain, but fails to capture the high phenotypic variation associated to the geographic heterogeneity in the Central European mountain ranges paired with the species history of postglacial migration. Still the model is used to provide recommendations of optimal provenance choice for future climate conditions. In essence, assisted migration may not decrease the predicted range decline of Norway spruce, but may help to capitalize on potential opportunities for increased growth associated with warmer climates.},

However, this situation can be largely reversed through appropriate planting density and thinning management. We evaluated the effects of initial planting density and selective thinning management on biomass accumulation and carbon stocks in different plantation compartments, on soil carbon stocks in different stand stages of a chronosequence of evergreen (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations in typical hilly and mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province, Southeast China. The result showed that biomass components and carbon storage of tree, understory and the whole ecosystem in C. lanceolata plantations were significantly higher with than without selective thinning treatment, in the low (1150 trees ha−1) than in the high (2460 trees ha−1) initial density in our study. Aboveground vegetation biomass and carbon storage in C. lanceolata plantations increased with stand stages. However, carbon storage of 0–10 cm and 20–40 cm soil depth decreased with stand stages, which indicated certain degraded characteristics of soil carbon in the C. lanceolata plantations. Interestingly, low initial density increased the biomass and carbon storage of trees, shrubs, herbs and 0–20 cm soil depth greater in the pre-mature and mature stands compared to high initial density. Furthermore, these positive effects of low density increased with selective thinning. According to regressions and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), increment in carbon of trees and 0–10 cm soil with the stand age were significantly higher in the low initial density and with selective thinning than in other three treatments. Therefore, selected thinning and relatively appropriate density might have a significantly positive role in carbon storage of the ecosystem in different stand ages, especially showing a increasing trend of soil carbon. Our results provide the important evidence for selective thinning management of C. lanceolata plantations with regeneration, which plays an important role in improving the carbon storage of degraded C. lanceolata plantations.},

We analyze variation in performance among modeling approaches as a function of the relative configuration of these two factors and the spatial extent of training region, with the result that a clear understanding of the abiotic-dispersal configuration is a prerequisite to effective model implementations; the effects of spatial extent of the training region are less consistent and clear.

Forest gaps are commonly created as small disturbances in secondary forests to improve forest regeneration, nutrient cycling, ecosystem functioning, and biodiversity. The objective of this study was to investigate the responses of the physico-chemical and biological properties and microbial communities in soil to different sizes of forest gaps—including small gaps (60–80 m2), medium gaps (130–160 m2), and large gaps (270–300 m2)—and to examine the driving factors that influence soil microbial community structure and composition. The results show that Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and actinomycetes were mainly aggregated in the gaps, and the structural diversity of soil microbial communities was related to the gap size (p < 0.05). The soil microbial community diversity increased and then decreased with an increase in gap size. Moreover, the effects of the available phosphorus, soil pH, soil water content, available potassium, nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen on changes in microbial biomass were significant (p < 0.05). The gap area and gap position and their combined interactions also had significant effects on soil nutrients, which impacts the soil microbial community. Medium gaps (130–160 m2) always significantly improved the availability of soil nutrients, and good management practices in secondary forests can provide effective microenvironments for soil microbes.},

   abstract = {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and environmental conditions, the "fit" of organisms to their environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near-optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related to habitat occupancy, e.g., environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i.e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck's concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which a species' distributional responses to environmental conditions will lead to a "mismatch" between its environmental tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1) the colonization of "environmental islands" (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the persistence of "trailing-edge" populations in species tracking changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space, in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous and changing environments.},

As temperatures rise, ecosystems with nowhere to go, such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened. However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climates ultimate persistence. Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr-1), derived from spatial gradients (°Ckm-1) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (°C yr-1) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earths surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr-1 (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr-1), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr-1), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Earlier spring leaf unfolding is a frequently observed response of plants to climate warming. Many deciduous tree species require chilling for dormancy release, and warming-related reductions in chilling may counteract the advance of leaf unfolding in response to warming. Empirical evidence for this, however, is limited to saplings or twigs in climate-controlled chambers. Using long-term in situ observations of leaf unfolding for seven dominant European tree species at 1,245 sites, here we show that the apparent response of leaf unfolding to climate warming (S T, expressed in days advance of leaf unfolding per °C warming) has significantly decreased from 1980 to 2013 in all monitored tree species. Averaged across all species and sites, S T decreased by 40% from 4.0 ± 1.8 days °C-1 during 1980-1994 to 2.3 ± 1.6 days °C-1 during 1999-2013. The declining S T was also simulated by chilling-based phenology models, albeit with a weaker decline (24-30%) than observed in situ. The reduction in S T is likely to be partly attributable to reduced chilling. Nonetheless, other mechanisms may also have a role, such as 'photoperiod limitation' mechanisms that may become ultimately limiting when leaf unfolding dates occur too early in the season. Our results provide empirical evidence for a declining S T, but also suggest that the predicted strong winter warming in the future may further reduce S T and therefore result in a slowdown in the advance of tree spring phenology.},

We examined the effects of climate, soil and logging disturbances on diameter growth rates at the tree and stand level, using 165 1-ha permanent sample plots distributed across Bolivian tropical lowland forests. We predicted that growth rates would be higher in humid than in dry forests, higher in nutrient-rich than nutrient-poor forests and higher in logged than non-logged forests. Across the 165 plots we found positive basal area increases at the stand level, which agree with the generally reported biomass increases in tropical forests. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that climate variables, in particular water availability, were the strongest drivers of tree growth. More rainfall, a shorter and less intense dry period and higher temperatures led to higher tree growth rates. Tree growth increased modestly with soil fertility and basal area growth was greatest at intermediate soil fertility. Surprisingly, tree growth showed little or no relationship with total soil nitrogen or plant available soil phosphorus. Growth rates increased in logged plots just after logging, but this effect disappeared after 6 years. Synthesis. Climate is the strongest driver of spatial variation in tree growth, and climate change may therefore have large consequences for forest productivity and carbon sequestration. The negative impact of decreased rainfall and increased rainfall seasonality on tree growth might be partly offset by the positive impact of increased temperature in these forests. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Amazon droughts have impacted regional ecosystem functioning as well as global carbon cycling. The severe dry-season droughts in 2005 and 2010, driven by Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, have been widely investigated in terms of drought severity and impacts on ecosystems. Although the influence of Pacific SST anomaly on wet-season precipitation has been well recognized, it remains uncertain to what extent the droughts driven by Pacific SST anomaly could affect forest greenness and photosynthesis in the Amazon. Here, we examined the monthly and annual dynamics of forest greenness and photosynthetic capacity when Amazon ecosystems experienced an extreme drought in 2015/2016 driven by a strong El Niño event. We found that the drought during August 2015–July 2016 was one of the two most severe meteorological droughts since 1901. Due to the enhanced solar radiation during this drought, overall forest greenness showed a small increase, and 21.6% of forests even greened up (greenness index anomaly ≥1 standard deviation). In contrast, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an indicator of vegetation photosynthetic capacity, showed a significant decrease. Responses of forest greenness and photosynthesis decoupled during this drought, indicating that forest photosynthesis could still be suppressed regardless of the variation in canopy greenness. If future El Niño frequency increases as projected by earth system models, droughts would result in persistent reduction in Amazon forest productivity, substantial changes in tree composition, and considerable carbon emissions from Amazon.},

   abstract = {Changes to forest production drivers (light, water, temperature, and site nutrient) over the last 55 years have been documented in peer-reviewed literature. The main objective of this paper is to review documented evidence of the impacts of climate change trends on forest productivity since the middle of the 20th century. We first present a concise overview of the climate controls of forest production, provide evidence of how the main controls have changed in the last 55 years, followed by a core section outlining our findings of observed and documented impacts on forest productivity and a brief discussion of the complications of interpreting trends in net primary production (NPP). At finer spatial scales, a trend is difficult to decipher, but globally, based on both satellite and ground-based data, climatic changes seemed to have a generally positive impact on forest productivity when water was not limiting. Of the 49 papers reporting forest production levels we reviewed, 37 showed a positive growth trend, five a negative trend, three reported both a positive and a negative trend for different time periods, one reported a positive and no trend for different geographic areas, and two reported no trend. Forests occupy ≈ 52% of the Earth's land surface and tend to occupy more temperature and radiation-limited environments. Less than 7% of forests are in strongly water-limited systems. The combined and interacting effects of temperature, radiation, and precipitation changes with the positive effect of CO2, the negative effects of O3 and other pollutants, and the presently positive effects of N will not be elucidated with experimental manipulation of one or a few factors at a time. Assessments of the greening of the biosphere depend on both accurate measurements of rates (net ecosystem exchange, NPP), how much is stored at the ecosystem level (net ecosystem production) and quantification of disturbances rates on final net biome production. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {The history of the life-Earth system can be divided into five 'energetic' epochs, each featuring the evolution of life forms that can exploit a new source of energy. These sources are: geochemical energy, sunlight, oxygen, flesh and fire. The first two were present at the start, but oxygen, flesh and fire are all consequences of evolutionary events. Since no category of energy source has disappeared, this has, over time, resulted in an expanding realm of the sources of energy available to living organisms and a concomitant increase in the diversity and complexity of ecosystems. These energy expansions have also mediated the transformation of key aspects of the planetary environment, which have in turn mediated the future course of evolutionary change. Using energy as a lens thus illuminates patterns in the entwined histories of life and Earth, and may also provide a framework for considering the potential trajectories of life-planet systems elsewhere.},

@article{Pecoits2015,
   abstract = {It is widely accepted that photosynthetic bacteria played a crucial role in Fe(II) oxidation and the precipitation of iron formations (IF) during the Late Archean-Early Paleoproterozoic (2.7-2.4 Ga). It is less clear whether microbes similarly caused the deposition of the oldest IF at ca. 3.8 Ga, which would imply photosynthesis having already evolved by that time. Abiological alternatives, such as the direct oxidation of dissolved Fe(II) by ultraviolet radiation may have occurred, but its importance has been discounted in environments where the injection of high concentrations of dissolved iron directly into the photic zone led to chemical precipitation reactions that overwhelmed photooxidation rates. However, an outstanding possibility remains with respect to photochemical reactions occurring in the atmosphere that might generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a recognized strong oxidant for ferrous iron. Here, we modeled the amount of H2O2 that could be produced in an Eoarchean atmosphere using updated solar fluxes and plausible CO2, O2, and CH4 mixing ratios. Irrespective of the atmospheric simulations, the upper limit of H2O2 rainout was calculated to be <106 molecules cm-2 s-1. Using conservative Fe(III) sedimentation rates predicted for submarine hydrothermal settings in the Eoarchean, we demonstrate that the flux of H2O2 was insufficient by several orders of magnitude to account for IF deposition (requiring ~1011 H2O2 molecules cm-2 s-1). This finding further constrains the plausible Fe(II) oxidation mechanisms in Eoarchean seawater, leaving, in our opinion, anoxygenic phototrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing micro-organisms the most likely mechanism responsible for Earth's oldest IF.},

@article{Stocks1998,
   abstract = {In this study outputs from four current General Circulation Models (GCMs) were used to project forest fire danger levels in Canada and Russia under a warmer climate. Temperature and precipitation anomalies between 1 CO2 and 2 CO2 runs were combined with baseline observed weather data for both countries for the 1980-1989 period. Forecast seasonal fire weather severity was similar for the four GCMs, indicating large increases in the areal extent of extreme fire danger in both countries under a 2 CO2 climate scenario. A monthly analysis, using the Canadian GCM, showed an earlier start to the fire season, and significant increases in the area experiencing high to extreme fire danger in both Canada and Russia, particularly during June and July. Climate change as forecast has serious implications for forest fire management in both countries. More severe fire weather, coupled with continued economic constraints and downsizing, mean more fire activity in the future is a virtual certainty. The likely response will be a restructuring of protection priorities to support more intensive protection of smaller, high-value areas, and a return to natural fire regimes over larger areas of both Canada and Russia, with resultant significant impacts on the carbon budget.},

@book{Binkley2019,
   abstract = {4th ed. Authors' names in reverse order on previous edition. Forest soils are the foundation of the entire forest ecosystem and complex, long-term interactions between trees, soil animals, and the microbial community shape soils in ways that are very distinct from agricultural soils. The composition, structure, and processes in forest soils at any given time reflect current conditions, as well as the legacies of decades (and even millennia) of interactions that shape each forest soil. Reciprocal interactions are fundamental; vegetation alters soil physical properties, which influence soil biology and chemistry, which in turn influence the growth and success of plants. These dynamic systems may be strongly influenced by intentional and unintentional management, ranging from fire to fertilization. Sustaining the long-term fertility of forest soils depends on insights about a diverse array of soil features and changes over space and time. Since the third edition of this successful book many new interests in forest soils and their management have arisen, including the role of forest soils in sequestering carbon, and how management influences rates of carbon accumulation. This edition also expands the consideration of how soils are sampled and characterized, and how tree species differ in their influence on soil development. Clearly structured throughout, the book opens with the origins of forest soil science and ends with the application of soil science principles to land management. This new edition provides : A completely revised and updated Fourth Edition of this classic textbook in the field A coherent overview of the major issues surrounding the ecology and management of forest soils Global in scope with coverage of soil types ranging from the tropical rainforest soils of Latin America to the boreal forest soils of Siberia New chapters on Management: Carbon sequestration; Evidence-based approaches and applications of geostatistics, GIS and taxonomies A clear overview of each topic, informative examples/case studies, and an overall context for helping readers think clearly about forest soils An introduction to the literature of forest soil science and to the philosophy of forest soil science research This coherent overview of the major issues surrounding the ecology and management of forest soils will be particularly useful to students taking courses in soil science, forestry, agronomy, ecology, natural resource management, environmental management and conservation, as well as professionals in forestry dealing with the productivity of forests and functioning of watersheds. 1.
