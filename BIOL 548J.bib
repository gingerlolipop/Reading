   abstract = {Fire shapes the distribution of savanna and forest through complex interactions involving climate, resources and species traits. Based on data from central Brazil, we propose that these interactions are governed by two critical thresholds. The fire-resistance threshold is reached when individual trees have accumulated sufficient bark to avoid stem death, whereas the fire-suppression threshold is reached when an ecosystem has sufficient canopy cover to suppress fire by excluding grasses. Surpassing either threshold is dependent upon long fire-free intervals, which are rare in mesic savanna. On high-resource sites, the thresholds are reached quickly, increasing the probability that savanna switches to forest, whereas low-resource sites are likely to remain as savanna even if fire is infrequent. Species traits influence both thresholds; saplings of savanna trees accumulate bark thickness more quickly than forest trees, and are more likely to become fire resistant during fire-free intervals. Forest trees accumulate leaf area more rapidly than savanna trees, thereby accelerating the transition to forest. Thus, multiple factors interact with fire to determine the distribution of savanna and forest by influencing the time needed to reach these thresholds. Future work should decipher multiple environmental controls over the rates of tree growth and canopy closure in savanna. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Recent work has indicated that tropical forest and savanna can be alternative stable states under a range of climatic conditions. However, dynamical systems theory suggests that in case of strong spatial interactions between patches of forest and savanna, a boundary between both states is only possible at conditions in which forest and savanna are equally stable, called the ‘Maxwell point.’ Frequency distributions of MODIS tree-cover data at 250 m resolution were used to estimate such Maxwell points with respect to the amount and seasonality of rainfall in both South America and Africa. We tested on a 0.5° scale whether there is a larger probability of local coexistence of forests and savannas near the estimated Maxwell points. Maxwell points for South America and Africa were estimated at 1760 and 1580 mm mean annual precipitation and at Markham’s Seasonality Index values of 50 and 24 %. Although the probability of local coexistence was indeed highest around these Maxwell points, local coexistence was not limited to the Maxwell points. We conclude that critical transitions between forest and savanna may occur when climatic changes exceed a critical value. However, we also conclude that spatial interactions between patches of forest and savanna may reduce the hysteresis that can be observed in isolated patches, causing more predictable forest-savanna boundaries than continental-scale analyses of tree cover indicate. This effect could be less pronounced in Africa than in South America, where the forest-savanna boundary is substantially affected by rainfall seasonality.},

   abstract = {Theoretically, fire-tree cover feedbacks can maintain savanna and forest as alternative stable states. However, the global extent of fire-driven discontinuities in tree cover is unknown, especially accounting for seasonality and soils. We use tree cover, climate, fire, and soils data sets to show that tree cover is globally discontinuous. Climate influences tree cover globally but, at intermediate rainfall (1000 to 2500 millimeters) with mild seasonality (less than 7 months), tree cover is bimodal, and only fire differentiates between savanna and forest. These may be alternative states over large areas, including parts of Amazonia and the Congo. Changes in biome distributions, whether at the cost of savanna (due to fragmentation) or forest (due to climate), will be neither smooth nor easily reversible.},

   abstract = {Forest–savanna mosaics exist across all major tropical regions. Yet, the influence of environmental factors on the distribution of these mosaics is not well explored, limiting our understanding of the environmental constraints on savannas especially in Southeast Asia, where most savannas exist in mosaics. Despite clear structural and functional characteristics indicative of savannas, most SE Asian savannas continue to be classified as forest. This designation is problematic because SE Asian savannas are threatened by both fragmentation and forest-centric management practices. By studying forest–savanna mosaics across SE Asia, we aimed to parse out how landscape mosaics of forest and savanna may be constrained by fire, climate and soil characteristics. We used remotely sensed data to characterize the distribution of tree cover and forest–savanna mosaics. Using regression models, we quantified the relative effects of precipitation, fire frequency, seasonality and soil characteristics on average tree cover and landscape patchiness. We found that low tree cover, indicative of savannas, occurs in drier, seasonal subregions that experience frequent fire. Further, our results demonstrate that fire and precipitation strongly shape landscape patchiness. Landscapes were patchiest in subregions with low precipitation and intermediate fire frequency. These results demonstrate that the environmental factors important in delineating the distribution of savannas globally shape the distribution of tree cover and landscape patchiness across SE Asia. Fire especially drives patterns of tree cover across scales. In a region where fire suppression is a common management strategy, our results suggest that further research studying vegetation response to fire and fire suppression is needed to improve management and conservation of these mosaic landscapes. More broadly, this work demonstrates a useful approach for studying the environmental drivers that influence the distribution of forest–savanna mosaics.},

   abstract = {In tropical landscapes, vegetation patches with contrasting tree densities are distributed as mosaics. However, the locations of patches and densities of trees within them cannot be predicted by climate models alone. It has been proposed that plant-fire feedbacks drive functional thresholds at a landscape scale, thereby maintaining open (savanna) and closed (forest) communities as two distinct stable states. However, there is little rigorous field evidence for this threshold model. Here we aim to provide support for such a model from a field perspective and to analyze the functional and phylogenetic consequences of fire in a Brazilian savanna landscape (Cerrado). We hypothesize that, in tropical landscapes, savanna and forest are two stable states maintained by plant-fire feedbacks. If so, their functional and diversity attributes should change abruptly along a community closure gradient. We set 98 plots along a gradient from open savanna to closed forest in the Brazilian Cerrado and tested for a threshold pattern in nine functional traits, five soil features, and seven diversity indicators. We then tested whether the threshold pattern was associated with different fire regimes. Most community attributes presented a threshold pattern on the savanna-forest transition with coinciding breakpoints. The thresholds separated two community states: (1) open environments with low-diversity communities growing in poor soils and dominated by plants that are highly resistant to high-intensity fires; and (2) closed environments with highly diverse plant communities growing in more fertile soils and dominated by shade-tolerant species that efficiently prevent light from reaching the understory. In addition, each state was associated with contrasting fire regimes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that forests and savannas are two coexisting stable states with contrasting patterns of function and diversity that are regulated by fire- plant feedbacks; our results also shed light on the mechanism driving each state. Overall, our results support the idea that fire plays an important role in regulating the distribution of savanna and forest biomes in tropical landscapes. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Carbon sequestration through tropical reforestation and natural regeneration could make an important contribution to climate change mitigation, given that forest cover in many tropical regions increased during the early part of the 21st century. The size of this carbon sink will depend on the degree to which second-growth forests are permanent and protected from re-clearing. Yet few studies have assessed permanence of reforestation, especially not at a large spatial scale. Here, we analyzed a 14-year time series (2001–2014) of remotely sensed land-cover data, covering all tropical Latin America and the Caribbean, to quantify the extent of second-growth forest permanence. Our results show that in many cases, reforestation in Latin America and the Caribbean during the early 21st century reversed by 2014, limiting carbon sequestration. In fact, reversals of reforestation, in which some or all gains in forest cover in the early 2000s were subsequently lost, were ten times more common than sustained increases in forest cover. Had reversals of reforestation been avoided, forests could have sequestered 0.58 Pg C, over four times more carbon than we estimate was sequestered after accounting for impermanence (0.14 Pg), representing a loss of 75% of carbon sequestration potential. Differences in the prevalence of reforestation reversals across countries suggest an important role for socio-economic, political, and ecological context, with political transitions and instability increasing the likelihood of reversals. These findings suggest that national commitments to reforestation may fall short of their carbon sequestration goals without provisions to ensure long-term permanence of new forests.},

   abstract = {Walker and Syers (1976) proposed a conceptual model that describes the pattern and regulation of soil nutrient pools and availability during long-term soil and ecosystem development. Their model implies that plant production generally should be limited by N on young soils and by P on old soils; N and P supply should more or less equilibrate on intermediate-aged soils. We tested the application of this model to nutrient limitation, using a well characterized substrate age sequence in Hawaiian montane rain forest. Earlier experiments had evaluated nutrient limitation in forests on a young (300 y) and an old (4,100,000 y) substrate on the same developmental sequence; N alone limited tree growth on the young substrate, while P alone did so on the old one. An additional fertilizer experiment based on replicated treatments with N, P, and all other nutrients combined, applied in individually and in all factorial combinations, was established in an intermediate-aged site in the Laupahoehoe Forest Reserve, Hawaii. Here, diameter increments of the dominant tree Metrosideros polymorpha increased slightly with N additions, and nearly doubled when N and P were added together. Additions of elements other than N and P had no significant effect on growth. These results show that N and P had equilibrated (relative to plant requirements) in the intermediate aged site. Together with the earlier experiments, these results suggest that the Walker and Syers model provides a useful starting point for explaining the nature and distribution of nutrient limitation in forest ecosystems.},

Radiotracer experiments examined the release and bioavailability of C, N, P Fe, and Se following viral lysis of the "brown tide" chrysophyte Aureococcus anophag-efSeerens. Photochemical effects on the dissolved-particulate partitioning and biological uptake of virally released elements were also investigated. Viral lysis of A. anophagefSerens released 50% more C and Se than uninfected control cells to the dissolved phase, while N, P, and Fe remained in the particulate phase. There was a significant inverse correlation between A. unophugefirens and bacterial densities, as well as an increase in particulate organic nitrogen levels in cultures during viral lysis. These observations indicate thitt released dissolved organic matter supported bacterial growth and may be a pathway by which various elements are diverted in microbial food webs. Dissolved nutrients released by viral lysis were accumulated to varying degrees by natural assemblages of marine bacteria and cultured diatoms, and virally regenerated N and P relieved diatom nutrient limitation. During a 4-wk incubation, 80% of C and P within cell lysis debris was released to the diss,olved phase, likely due to bacterial activity. Photochemical degradation of cell lysis debris enhanced dissolved levels of Se (100%) and Fe (50%) and reduced total dissolved C by 15%. Photochemistry doubled the bioavailability of virally released Se to diatoms, while decreasing the bioavailability of C to bacteria threefold. The viral lysis of an A. unophugefirens bloom in the field could release 40 PM dissolved organic carbon and rapidly transfer other released elements to bacteria. Such occurrences may significantly affect water column chemistry, species composition, and succession within marine plankton communities.},

These sources are: geochemical energy, sunlight, oxygen, flesh and fire. The first two were present at the start, but oxygen, flesh and fire are all consequences of evolutionary events. Since no category of energy source has disappeared, this has, over time, resulted in an expanding realm of the sources of energy available to living organisms and a concomitant increase in the diversity and complexity of ecosystems. These energy expansions have also mediated the transformation of key aspects of the planetary environment, which have in turn mediated the future course of evolutionary change. Using energy as a lens thus illuminates patterns in the entwined histories of life and Earth, and may also provide a framework for considering the potential trajectories of life-planet systems elsewhere.},

At hydrothermal vents, spontaneous synthesis of methane via serpentinization links an energy metabolic reaction with a geochemical homologue. If the first cells were autotrophs, how did the first heterotrophs arise, and what was their substrate? We propose that cell mass roughly similar to the composition of Escherichia coli was the substrate for the first chemoorganoheterotrophs. Amino acid fermentations, pathways typical of anaerobic clostridia and common among anaerobic archaea, in addition to clostridial type purine fermentations, might have been the first forms of heterotrophic carbon and energy metabolism. Ribose was probably the first abundant sugar, and the archaeal type III RubisCO pathway of nucleoside monophosphate conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate might be a relic of ancient heterotrophy. Participation of chemiosmotic coupling and flavin-based electron bifurcation - a soluble energy coupling process - in clostridial amino acid and purine fermentations is consistent with an autotrophic origin of both metabolism and heterotrophy, as is the involvement of S0 as an electron acceptor in the facilitated fermentations of anaerobic heterotrophic archaea.},
