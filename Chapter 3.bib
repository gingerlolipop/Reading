   abstract = {Cloud forest is a sensitive and vulnerable ecosystem that is threatened by human activities as well as climate change. Previous studies have shown how transitional ecosystems such as cloud forests will be the most negatively impacted by the global increase in temperature. Therefore, the niche modeling framework was used in this study to geographically identify the areas with the climatic potential to host the largest number of key tree species in this ecosystem and to propose them as priority conservation areas. A total of 19 species were modeled using the MaxEnt algorithm; binary maps were generated for each species and combined to produce one potential suitability map and identify climatic priority areas. Thus, 7% of the national area of Mexico shows suitability for the cloud forest ecosystem, although it is currently distributed in less than 1% of the country. Finally, potential suitability areas were compared with natural protected areas, current land use and priority conservation areas. We found that (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). i An update to this article is included at the end of the current suitable area, only 5% coincides with some federal or state protection regime. Natural protected areas have proven to be a mechanism for forest conservation, so we must consider increasing the number and area of those protected areas that favor the conservation of these key cloud forest species.},

   abstract = {Aim: This paper demonstrates methods to extend standardized vegetation zone descriptions and mapped distributions across political boundaries. An extended climate niche for North America's Coastal Douglas-fir (CDF) forest zone is determined and projected to evaluate its potential distribution under a changing climate and to identify climate refugia for conservation planning. Location: Pacific Northwest temperate rain forest in British Columbia (BC), CA, and nearby Washington (WA) and Oregon (OR), US. Methods: Using a combination of ecosystem polygon mapping and ecological plot data with climate interpolation tools, forests characterized as CDF under BC's biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification system were identified in the neighbouring US. Current (baseline) limits to CDF distribution were identified and used to map its potential distribution and climate refugia under future climate conditions using ensemble Global Climate Model projections. Results: The extended CDF climate niche covers 76 725 km2 under baseline conditions, with the majority of the area in the Pacific Northwest US. The extended CDF forest zone includes a vegetation assemblage consistent with existing definitions of BC's CDF moist maritime subzone, but also an additional vegetation assemblage representing a drier maritime subzone. Projections of future climate suggest a northerly shift (~150 km) and a decrease (-91.5%) in overall CDF area. Climate refugia are projected for discontinuous patches of CDF forest on Vancouver Island and adjacent mainland. Conclusions: This project combined georeferenced ecological plot data and digital maps, thereby facilitating the international mapping of ecosystem distributions in adjacent administrative areas that do not currently use the same ecosystem classification and mapping systems. This approach and the concept of climate niche definition, distribution and persistence are applicable to the management, restoration and conservation of plant communities, particularly in evaluating future ecosystem range shifts and disruptions associated with a changing climate. The potential for dramatic reductions in the range of the Coastal Douglas-fir zone, with persistence in <15% of its current area, suggest that most of the extended CDF zone is marginally suitable for the characteristic CDF ecosystems and that slight shifts in climate or disturbance regime may greatly alter the character of the vegetation. The full climatic niche for British Columbia's Coastal Douglas-fir forest zone is determined from its mapped distribution and georeferenced plot data in the neighbouring USA. A new subzone is characterized, and the potential distribution of the extended zone is projected under a changing climate to identify climate refugia. For sensitive ecosystems with multi-jurisdictional distributions, this approach helps focus conservation efforts.},

In this paper, we evaluate two widely used climate models for British Columbia with respect to their general precision and regional bias. We discuss limitations due to the resolution of the current "state of the art" PRISM climate model and provide new methodology for "intelligent" up-sampling of the PRISM model for studies that require spatially explicit climate data. In order to stress the importance of choosing an adequate climate model and understanding its limitations, we provide two examples where baseline climate models caused misleading predictions of how the climate envelope of ecosystems shifts as a consequence of increased temperature, and how tree growth may respond to climate change. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Predictive models using various climatic and topographical factors influencing Brown oak's growth and survival were developed to define its current ecological niche. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method involving Saaty's pair-wise comparison was performed to rank the explanatory powers of each compared variable. Variables were suitably weighted using fuzzy factor standardization scheme to reflect their relative importance in defining species niche. An optimum indicator was then chosen for deriving a site suitability map of brown oak. This study establishes the role of aspect in the current distribution of the species along with known influence of altitude. Future niches of oak has been tracked in the projected climate change scenario of +1 o C and +2 o C rise in temperature and 20 mm in precipitation. The results show that on predicted +1 o C and +2 o C increase in temperature, present habitat of brown oak distribution may be reduced by 40 per cent and 76 per cent respectively.},

However, their natural distribution remains unclear, which will also be affected by the changing climatic conditions. The main purpose of this study was to map and predict the current and future potential suitable habitats of these two species using MaxEnt based on the presence location of species and environmental variables. The results showed that A. truncatum was more suitable for warm and humid climates and was more durable to climate change compared to X. sorbifolium. Under the current environmental conditions, the suitable habitat of A. truncatum was mainly concentrated in Inner Mongolia Plateau, Loess Plateau, Sichuan Basin, Northeast Plain, North China Plain, Korean Peninsula, as well as Japan, with an area of 115.39 × 104 km2 . X. sorbifolium was mainly distributed in Inner Mongolia Plateau and Loess Plateau with an area of 146.15 × 104 km2 . Under future climate scenarios, the model predicted that higher concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions could result in greater expansion of the potential distribution of both species. Meanwhile, the study also revealed that the two species migrated to the north by east to varying degrees with the change in suitable habitats. This work could provide scientific basis for resource protection and utilization of the two economic forest trees.},

This study investigated the impact of climate change on natural habitats by using 55 Phasianidae species. We predicted current and future species distribution based on three climate change scenarios. We then (1) determined the effect of climate change on each species by comparing the distribution and elevation range shift between current and future predictions. In addition, we (2) estimated the total large habitat patches (> 40 km2) for each species, and determine how it change in the future. We also (3) investigated large habitat patches change within PAs. Moreover, we (4) evaluated the Phasianidae diversity hotspots in the current and future predictions. The results showed climate change is likely to reduce the suitable natural habitats in Southeast Asia, with an average reduction of habitat patches was 180,970 km2 (11%) when comparing the future predictions with the current state. Most of the species appeared to be retreating to higher altitudes and face suitable habitat reduction by 2100. The large habitat patch average declined 183,474 km2 (12%), with 2–10 species in imminent danger of losing their habitat (depending on the climate change modeling scenarios). The current large patches in the protected areas represented a small proportion of the total large patch distribution, and there were fewer future large patches than currently available. The species risk a reduction in diversity, especially in the Indo-Burma region where most of them are facing a massive loss of their suitable habitats. We suggest the use of Phasianidae as indicator species to monitor natural forests in Southeast Asia and the implementation of adaptive conservation management to prevent further losses in the future.},

This study aimed at producing a current habitat suitability map and predicting future potential habitat distribution for M. cajuputi in Terengganu based on Species distribution modeling (SDM) using the Maximum Entropy principle. Our modeling results show that for the current potential distribution of M. cajuputi species, only 10.82% (1346.5 km2) of Terengganu area is suitable habitat, which 0.96% of the areas are under high, 2.44% moderate and 7.42% poor habitat suitability. The model prediction for future projection shows that the habitat suitability for M. cajuputi would decrease significantly in the year 2050 under RCP 4.5 where the largest contraction from suitable to unsuitable habitat area is about 442.1 km2 and under RCP 2.6 is the highest expansion from unsuitable to suitable habitat area (267.5 km2). From the future habitat suitability projection, we found that the habitat suitability in Marang would degrade significantly under all climate scenarios, while in Setiu the habitat suitability for M. cajuputi remains stable throughout the climate change scenarios. The modeling prediction shows a significant influence on the soil properties, temperature, and precipitation during monsoon months. These results could benefit conservationist and policymakers for decision making. The present model could also give a perception into potential habitat suitability of M. cajuputi in the future and to improve our understanding of the species’ response under the changing climate.},

It is cultivated mostly in the warm temperate Mediterranean coastal region, and in the tropical and subtropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It also grows naturally in northeast India, Myanmar, and Yunnan (China). Citron populations are declining in their natural habitats due to forest degradation and change in land use patterns. To predict the habitat suitability for citron, we evaluated four widely used species distribution models (SDMs), namely Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) in ‘sdm’ package. Based on Area under ROC Curve (AUC; >0.97) and True Skill Statistics (TSS; >0.9) of all four models, an ensemble modeling was carried out using 111 geo-referenced datasets and 19 bioclimatic and three topographic variables under three climate change scenarios (current, 2050 and 2070). Precipitation of warmest quarter (bio18, 69.6%), elevation (11.1%), mean temperature of wettest quarter (bio8, 10.6%), and temperature seasonality (bio4, 10.1%) were the most important environmental variables for determining the distribution of citron in the study area. Potentially suitable habitat for citron was predicted to occur from 12 – 29 °N to 79 – 108 °E. The total suitable habitat covers about 875,868 km2, including 195,846 km2, 274,386 km2, and 405,636 km2, representing high, moderate, and least suitable areas, respectively. Increase in habitat suitability was predicted for 2050 and 2070 under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs), i. e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5. This study predicted that northeast India and northern Myanmar would remain moderately or highly suitable for citron.},

Results indicated that mean diurnal range, isothermality, cation exchange capacity (at pH 7), and temperature seasonality were key variables influencing habitat suitability for F. squamosa. However, temperature seasonality and precipitation of the driest quarter showed the greatest contributions to F. heterostyla distribution. During the current period, the habitat suitability distributions of both Ficus species were considerably higher than known occurrences. In the future, potentially suitable distribution areas for both species will reduce overall across the whole study area, although some expansion may occur by 2070. Niche overlap of suitable areas for both species was initially high and then declined in the current period and future epochs in the RCP 2.6 scenario, but increased in the RCP 8.5 scenario. In short, the responses of both Ficus species to climate change differed. Thus, specific actions such as ex situ conservation and assisted migration may be needed to conserve both species.},

The extents of teak forests are shrinking due to deforestation and the local impacts of global climate change. However, the direct impacts of climate changes on the continental-scale distributions of native and non-native teak have not been examined. In this study, we developed a species distribution model for teak across its entire native distribution in tropical Asia, and its non-native distribution in Bangladesh. We used presence-only records of trees and twelve environmental variables that were most representative for current teak distributions in South and Southeast Asia. MaxEnt (maximum entropy) models were used to model the distributions of teak under current and future climate scenarios. We found that land use/land cover change and elevation were the two most important variables explaining the current and future distributions of native and non-native teak in tropical Asia. Changes in annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality and annual mean actual evapotranspiration may result in shifts in the distributions of teak across tropical Asia. We discuss the implications for the conservation of critical teak habitats, forest management planning, and risks of biological invasion that may occur due to its cultivation in non-native ranges.},

A climate niche model was developed and used to project the suitable climatic conditions for each of the five seed zones for current and various future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Our results indicated that the Subtropical seed zone would show consistent reduction for all climate change scenarios. The remaining seed zones, however, would experience various degrees of expansion in suitable habitat relative to their current geographic distributions. Most of the seed zones would gain suitable habitats at their northern distribution margins and higher latitudes.

Thus, it is imperative to conserve the diversity of Sapindus. This study aimed to reveal the potential habitat distribution patterns of Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak in response to the current environment and future climate change. Furthermore, we aimed to identify hotspots of habitat degradation/expansion to facilitate climate change-adaptive biological conservation. Using current environmental data and future climate projections (2021–2100), we simulated the present and potential future habitats of Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model that was developed based on 2041 occurrence records. The model showed that precipitation may play an important role in framing the potential habitats of Sapindus. Notably, S. delavayi was more sensitive to minimum temperatures (−4 °C to 5.5 °C), soil moisture (82–132 mm), and elevation (1200–3200 m), whereas S. rarak was the most sensitive to isothermality (50–86) and soil moisture (54–126). Under the current environment, Sapindus mukorossi had the widest suitable habitat distribution (252.50 × 104 km2), followed by that of Sapindus rarak (215.62 × 104 km2) and Sapindus delavayi (90.86 × 104 km2). Under future climate change scenarios, the habitat distribution of Sapindus mukorossi was predicted to expand at higher latitudes and extensively contract at lower latitudes. Moreover, the projected suitable habitat distribution of S. delavayi showed inconspicuous expansion and contraction, whereas that S. rarak underwent conspicuous contraction and expansion. Moreover, there were distinct ecological habits among Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak in the east and southeast Asia. Thus, it is recommended that the contraction areas should be preferentially subjected to germplasm collection and conservation. Based on these findings, we propose preserved areas as the base for future Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak conservation, breeding, cultivation, and utilisation.},

The rare and endangered plants are important biodiversity elements. However, the lack of comprehensive and reliable information on the spatial distribution of these organisms has hampered holistic and efficient conservation management measures. We explored the consequences of climate change on the geographical distribution of Firmiana kwangsiensis (Malvaceae), an endangered species, to provide a reference for conservation, introduction, and cultivation of this species in new ecological zones. Modeling of the potential distribution of F. kwangsiensis under the current and two future climate scenarios in maximum entropy was performed based on 30 occurrence records and 27 environmental variables of the plant. We found that precipitation-associated and temperature-associated variables limited the potentially suitable habitats for F. kwangsiensis. Our model predicted 259,504 km2 of F. kwangsiensis habitat based on 25 percentile thresholds. However, the high suitable habitat for F. kwangsiensis is only about 41,027 km2. F. kwangsiensis is most distributed in Guangxi's protected areas. However, the existing reserves are only 2.7% of the total suitable habitat and 4.2% of the high suitable habitat for the plant, lower than the average protection area in Guangxi (7.2%). This means the current protected areas network is insufficient, underlining the need for alternative conservation mechanisms to protect the plant habitat. Our findings will help identify additional F. kwangsiensis localities and potential habitats and inform the development and implementation of conservation, management, and cultivation practices of such rare tree species.},

   abstract = {Predicting climatic niche of species and projecting their potential range shifts in geographic distribution under future climate scenarios is essential for assessing impacts of climate change. Ecological niche-based models are widely used to map habitat suitability of current and future potential distribution of species, using precise coordinates of species occurrences, along with climatic and various environmental variables. Despite the importance of high dependence on forest resources in the Himalayan region, the direct impacts of climate change on major forest tree species is not well-documented. In the present study, we used MaxEnt (or maximum entropy) modelling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of four ecologically and economically dominant forest tree species (Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda, and Pinus roxburghii) in the central Himalayan region. Future predictions were based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for two time periods (2050s and 2070s). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt by combining different climatic, geomorphologic, and pedologic variables as predictor variables to model the potential climatic niches. We evaluated the model performance with an average AUC value varying as 0.809 (±0.020), 0.982 (±0.008), 0.966 (±0.006), and 0.803 (±0.025) for Q. leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda and P. roxburghii, respectively. Depending upon the RCPs, the results show both increase and decrease in suitable habitat range of these species across all future climate scenarios. The shifts in geographic distributions of climatic niches show unusual patterns, implying the need for urgent adaptive forest management strategies. Our approach can be used as a baseline database for broad-scale applicability in forest tree species restoration and conservation planning.},

The model performance was excellent for the climate model (AUC = 0.92) and good for the soil model (AUC = 0.84). Three climate variables (degree-days below zero, mean coldest month temperature, and mean annual precipitation) and two soil variables (subsoil cation exchange capacity and topsoil cation exchange capacity) were the main factors determining the distribution of ginkgo fruit forests. The level of predicted habitat suitability was consistent with the differences observed in fruit traits, suggesting that our model predictions make biological and economic sense. The high- and medium-suitable habitats of this species would decrease in future climates under both the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios.

The lack of information on their ecology and distribution is a constraint for restoration and conservation of these forests. The last study to describe dry forest communities in Myanmar was conducted in the 1960s, and was based on their physiognomy and the dominant tree species. We investigated the species composition of the dry forest communities in the central dry zone of Myanmar, and developed environmental distribution models. Based on presence/absence vegetation surveys, we classified the community types using TWINSPAN. We obtained 14 statistically significant basic community types, which we combined into five alliances and two orders. Community types were generally divided into two groups at the order level: woody communities in the forest landscapes and in the anthropogenic (agricultural and residential) landscapes. Tectona hamiltoniana and Terminalia oliveri were abundant in the forest landscapes, whereas Prosopis juliflora and Borassus flabellifer were common in the anthropogenic landscapes. Acacia catechu and Waltheria indica were distributed in communities with intermediate characteristics between the forest and anthropogenic landscapes. Communities in the anthropogenic landscapes lacked species from the forest landscapes. Forest landscape communities were endemic to Myanmar's dry zone, and T. hamiltoniana was dominant. A novel community of alien P. juliflora which is common to the world's dry forests, was detected in the anthropogenic landscapes. We predicted the distribution of dry forest communities across the study area using a logistic regression model based on landscape types and mesoscale environmental variables. Landscape was the most significant factor that explained the distribution of the communities, followed by elevation. The forest landscape communities, especially the Shorea siamensis- T. hamiltoniana and T. hamiltoniana- T. oliveri forest alliances were rare in the study area. The limited area of these communities suggested their importance for conservation planning.},

This study aimed to evaluate the consequences of climate change on geographical distributions and habitat suitability of 14 threatened forest tree species in the Philippines. Based on the principle of maximum entropy, it utilized a machine algorithm called Maxent to estimate a target probability distribution and habitat suitability of the selected species. Threatened forest tree species occurrence records and sets of biophysical and bioclimatic variables were inputted to Maxent program to predict current and future distribution of the species. The Maxent models of the threatened species were evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under Curve (ROC AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS) tests which revealed that the models generated were better than random. The Maxent models ROC AUC values of the 14 species range from 0.70 to 0.972 which is higher than 0.5 of a null model. Based on TSS criteria, Maxent models performed good in two species, very good in ten species, and excellent in two species. Seven species (Afzelia rhomboidea; Koordersiodendron pinnatum; Mangifera altissima; Shorea contorta; Shorea palosapis; Shorea polysperma; Vitex parviflora) were found to likely benefit from future climate due to the potential increase in their suitable habitat while the other seven species (Agathis philippinensis; Celtis luzonica; Dipterocarpus grandiflorus; Shorea guiso; Shorea negrosensis; Toona calantas; Vatica mangachapoi) will likely experience decline in their suitable habitat. This study provided an initial understanding on how the distribution of threatened forest trees will be affected by climate change in the Philippines. The generated species distribution models and habitat suitability maps could be used as basis in formulating appropriate science-based adaptation policies, strategies and measures that could enhance the resilience of those threatened forest tree species and their natural ecosystems to current and future climate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Myanmar is exceptionally rich in biodiversity but has a small protected area system. This study aimed to assess the potential vulnerability of this system to climate change. In the absence of good biodiversity data, we used a spatial modeling approach based on a statistically derived bioclimatic stratification (the Global Environmental Stratification, GEnS) to understand the spatial implications of projected climate change for Myanmar's protected area system by 2050 and 2070. Nine bioclimatic zones and 41 strata were recognized in Myanmar, but their representation in the protected area system varied greatly, with the driest zones especially underrepresented. Under climate change, most zones will shift upslope, with some protected areas projected to change entirely to a new bioclimate. Potential impacts on biodiversity include mountaintop extinctions of species endemic to isolated peaks, loss of climate specialists from small protected areas and those with little elevational range, and woody encroachment into savannas and open forests as a result of both climate change and rising atmospheric CO2. Myanmar needs larger, better connected, and more representative protected areas, but political, social, and economic problems make this difficult.},

We developed models to evaluate potential shifts for 80 individual tree species in the eastern United States. First, environmental factors associated with current ranges of tree species were assessed using geographic information systems (GIS) in conjunction with regression tree analysis (RTA). The method was then extended to better understand the potential of species to survive and/or migrate under a changed climate. We collected, summarized, and analyzed data for climate, soils, land use, elevation, and species assemblages for >2100 counties east of the 100th meridian. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data for >100 000 forested plots in the East provided the tree species range and abundance information for the trees. RTA was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution as well as predict the future potential distributions under two scenarios of climate change with twofold increases in the level of atmospheric CO2. Validation measures prove the utility of the RTA modeling approach for mapping current tree importance values across large areas, leading to increased confidence in the predictions of potential future species distributions. With our analysis of potential effects, we show that roughly 30 species could expand their range and/or weighted importance at least 10%, while an additional 30 species could decrease by at least 10%, following equilibrium after a changed climate. Depending on the global change scenario used, 4-9 species would potentially move out of the United States to the north. Nearly half of the species assessed (36 out of 80) showed the potential for the ecological optima to shift at least 100 km to the north, including seven that could move >250 km. Given these potential future distributions, actual species redistributions will be controlled by migration rates possible through fragmented landscapes.},

Here, we present a deep learning approach that directly estimates species richness, skipping the step of estimating individual species ranges. We train a neural network model based on species lists from inventory plots, which provide ground truth data for supervised machine learning. The model learns to predict species richness based on spatially associated variables, including climatic and geographic predictors, as well as counts of available species records from online databases. We assess the empirical utility of our approach by producing independently verifiable maps of alpha, beta, and gamma plant diversity at high spatial resolutions for Australia, a continent with highly heterogeneous diversity patterns. Our deep learning framework provides a powerful and flexible new approach for estimating biodiversity patterns, constituting a step forward toward automated biodiversity assessments.},

The goal of the current study is to determine the probable habitat distribution range of the narrowly endemic species Gluta travancorica. An ecological niche modelling is carried out, using four different models viz., BioClim, MaxEnt, Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). A total of 506 G. travancorica cluster locations were surveyed and used for this study with thirty different ecogeographic, edaphic and bioclimatic environmental parameters. After a preliminary investigation using multi-collinearity analysis, soil parameter variables like pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), silt and clay content are used for final modelling. Factor analysis of ecological niche revealed the soil parameters like pH, CEC, silt and clay content as the key predictors. The result is validated using true skill statistics, sensitivity, specificity, kappa statistic and AUC-ROC. Results of the present study show that DNN have exceptional prediction performance, demonstrated by its AUC score of 0.959. DNN model projected 32.37% (938.18 km2) of the study region to have a ‘highly suitable habitat’, whereas 67.63% (1960.82 km2) was classified as having ‘low habitat suitability’. Besides, back-to-field assessments have also proven DNN's potential in predicting the habitat suitability of G. travancorica. The study results will facilitate the prioritization of conservation and seedling restoration strategies. The forest range explored in this work is a component of one of the most important global biodiversity hotspots, and it has significant implications for regional biodiversity conservation.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions are expected to globally impact the biological function, community structure, and spatial distribution of biodiversity. Many existing studies explore the effect of climate change on biodiversity, generally at a single spatial scale. This study explores the potential effects of climate change on the habitat suitability of seven tree species at two distinct spatial scales: the Coronado National Forest (CNF), a local management area, and the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), an ecoregional extent. Habitat suitability was determined by extrapolating Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) based on citizen-science tree occurrence records into future climatic conditions using projected 30-year normals for two anthropogenic emissions scenarios through the end of the century. These ENMs, examined at a spatial resolution of 1 km2, are constructed using a mean average ensemble of three commonly used machine learning algorithms. The results show that habitat suitability is expected to decrease for all seven tree species at varying degrees. Results also show that climate-forcing scenario choice appears to be far less important for understanding changes in species habitat suitability than the spatial scale of modeling extent. Additionally, we observed non-linear changes in tree species habitat suitability within the SMO and CNF dependent on forest community type, latitude, and elevational gradient. The paper concludes with a discussion of the necessary steps to verify the estimated alters of these tree species under climate change. Most importantly, provides a framework for characterizing habitat suitability across spatial scales.},

In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted “punctual models”). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (“ablation experiments”). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.},

This is because it is expected to balance accuracy and robustness of SDM models. However, there are little available data regarding the spatial similarity of the combined distribution maps generated by different consensus approaches. Here, using eight niche-based models, nine split-sample calibration bouts (or nine random model-training subsets), and nine climate change scenarios, the distributions of 32 forest tree species in China were simulated under current and future climate conditions. The forecasting ensembles were combined to determine final consensual prediction maps for target species using three simple consensus approaches (average, frequency, and median [PCA]). Species' geographic ranges changed (area change and shifting distance) in response to climate change, but the three consensual projections did not differ significantly with respect to how much or in which direction, but they did differ with respect to the spatial similarity of the three consensual predictions. Incongruent areas were observed primarily at the edges of species' ranges. Multiple stepwise regression models showed the three factors (niche marginality and specialization, and niche model accuracy) to be related to the observed variations in consensual prediction maps among consensus approaches. Spatial correspondence among prediction maps was the highest when niche model accuracy was high and marginality and specialization were low. The difference in spatial predictions suggested that more attention should be paid to the range of spatial uncertainty before any decisions regarding specialist species can be made based on map outputs. The niche properties and single-model predictive performance provide promising insights that may further understanding of uncertainties in SDM.},

It computes, for each species and in the same package, the four most widely used modelling techniques in species predictions, namely Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Classification and Regression Tree analysis (CART) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). BIOMOD was applied to 61 species of trees in Europe using climatic quantities as explanatory variables of current distributions. On average, all the different modelling methods yielded very good agreement between observed and predicted distributions. However, the relative performance of different techniques was idiosyncratic across species, suggesting that the most accurate model varies between species. The results of this evaluation also highlight that slight differences between current predictions from different modelling techniques are exacerbated in future projections. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the reliability of alternative projections without validation techniques or expert opinion. It is concluded that rather than using a single modelling technique to predict the distribution of several species, it would be more reliable to use a framework assessing different models for each species and selecting the most accurate one using both evaluation methods and expert knowledge.},

A general problem with most of these habitat modelling approaches is that the estimated response curves can display biologically implausible shapes which do not respect ecological niche theory. This work proposes using shape-constrained generalized additive models (SC-GAMs) to build species distribution models under the ecological niche theory framework, imposing concavity constraints in the linear predictor scale. Based on a simulation study and a real data application, we compared performance with respect to other regression models without shape-constraints (such as standard GLMs and GAMs with varying degrees of freedom) and also to models based on so-called “Plateau” climate-envelopes. The imposition of concavity for response curves resulted in a good balance between the goodness of fit (GOF) and agreement with ecological niche theory. The approach has been applied to fit distribution models for three fish species given several environmental variables.},

Analyses of the communities were based on a gridded sample of ca. 140,000 points, while those for the species used presence-absence data from ca. 120,000 locations. Independent variables included 35 simple expressions of temperature and precipitation and their interactions. Classification errors for community models averaged 19%, but the errors were reduced by half when adjusted for misalignment between geographic data sets. Errors of omission for species-specific models approached 0, while errors of commission were less than 9%. Mapped climate profiles of the species were in solid agreement with range maps. Climate variables of most importance for segregating the communities were those that generally differentiate maritime, continental, and monsoonal climates, while those of importance for predicting the occurrence of species varied among species but consistently implicated the periodicity of precipitation and temperature-precipitation interactions. Projections showed that unmitigated global warming should increase the abundance primarily of the montane forest and grassland community profiles at the expense largely of those of the subalpine, alpine, and tundra communities but also that of the arid woodlands. However, the climate of 47% of the future landscape may be extramural to contemporary community profiles. Effects projected on the spatial distribution of species-specific profiles were varied, but shifts in space and altitude would be extensive. Species-specific projections were not necessarily consistent with those of their communities. © 2006 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Species climate niche models (CNMs) have been widely used for assessing climate change impact, developing conservation strategies and guiding assisted migration for adaptation to future climates. However, the CNMs built based on species occurrence data only reflect the species’ realized niche, which can overestimate the potential loss of suitable habitat of existing forests and underestimate the potential of assisted migration to mitigate climate change. In this study, we explored building a fundamental climate niche model using widely available species occurrence data with two important forest tree species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Franco.), which were introduced to many countries worldwide. We first compared and optimized three individual modeling techniques and their ensemble by adjusting the ratio of presence to absence (p/a) observations using an innovative approach to predict the realized climate niche of the two species. We then extended the realized climate niches to their fundamental niches by determining a new cut-off threshold based on species occurrence data beyond the native distributions. We found that the ensemble model comprising Random Forest and Maxent had the best performance and identified a common cut-off threshold of 0.3 for predicting the fundamental climate niches of the two species, which is likely applicable to other species. We then predicted the fundamental climate niches of the two species under current and future climate conditions. Our study demonstrated a novel approach for predicting species’ fundamental climate niche with high accuracy using only species occurrence data, including both presence and absence data points. It provided a new tool for assessing climate change impact on the future loss of existing forests and implementing assisted migration for better adapting to future climates.},

   abstract = {Melia azedarach L. is an important economic tree widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of China and some other countries. However, it is unclear how the species’ suitable habitat will respond to future climate changes. We aimed to select the most accurate one among seven data mining models to predict the current and future suitable habitats for M. azedarach in China. These models include: maximum entropy (MaxEnt), support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), naive bayesian model (NBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). A total of 906 M. azedarach locations were identified, and sixteen climate predictors were used for model building. The models’ validity was assessed using three measures (Area Under the Curves (AUC), kappa, and overall accuracy (OA)). We found that the RF provided the most outstanding performance in prediction power and generalization capacity. The top climate factors affecting the species’ suitable habitats were mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), followed by the number of frost-free days (NFFD), degree-days above 18 °C (DD > 18), temperature difference between MWMT and MCMT, or continentality (TD), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and degree-days below 18 °C (DD < 18). We projected that future suitable habitat of this species would increase under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for the 2011–2040 (2020s), 2041–2070 (2050s), and 2071–2100 (2080s). Our findings are expected to assist in better understanding the impact of climate change on the species and provide scientific basis for its planting and conservation.},

Under these conditions leaf growth is curtailed more than C fixation, and the surplus photosynthates are exported from the leaf. In plants limited by nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), photosynthates are converted into sugars and secondary metabolites. Some surplus C is translocated to roots and released as root exudates or transferred to root-associated microorganisms. Surplus C is also produced under low moisture availability, low temperature, and high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with similar below-ground effects. Many interactions among above- and below-ground ecosystem components can be parsimoniously explained by the production, distribution, and release of surplus C under conditions that limit plant growth.},

Here we compare the structure and function of soil microbial communities in seven mature, undisturbed forest types across a range of regional climates in British Columbia and Alberta, and examine the variation in community composition within forest types. We collected the forest floor fermentation (F) and humus (H) layers and upper 10 cm of mineral soil at 3 sites in each of seven forest types (corresponding to seven Biogeoclimatic zones) in both spring and summer. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis was used to investigate the structure of soil microbial communities and total soil microbial biomass; potential activities of extra-cellular enzymes indicated the functional potential of the soil microbial community in each layer at each site.Multivariate analysis indicated that both structure and enzyme activities of soil microbial communities differed among the forest types, and significantly separated along the regional climate gradient, despite high local variation. Soil moisture and organic matter contents were most closely related to microbial community characteristics. Forests in the Ponderosa Pine and Mountain Hemlock zones were distinct from other forests and from each other when comparing potential enzyme activities and had the most extreme moisture and temperature values. Forest floors from the hot and dry Ponderosa Pine forests were associated with enzymes characteristic of water-stress and high concentrations of phenols and other recalcitrant compounds. The wet and cold Mountain Hemlock forests were associated with low enzyme activity.An influence of tree species was apparent at the three sites within the Coastal Western Hemlock zone; high bacterial:fungal biomass ratios were found under western redcedar (Thuja plicata) which also had high pH and base-cation levels, and under Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), which had high N availability. Potential activities enzymes differed among soil layers: potential activities of phenol oxidase and peroxidase were highest in mineral soil, whereas phosphatase, betaglucosidase, NAGase, sulfatase, xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase were highest in the forest floors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Organic matter is of primary importance to the sustainability of long-term site productivity in forest ecosystems. In boreal forests, organic matter accumulates at the surface as mor humus. This may represent a substantial portion of the total nutrient capital of a site, and its decomposition is essential for the short-term availability of nutrients for tree growth and long-term site fertility. However, organic matter accumulation at the soil surface can also effect the forest ecosystem by immobilizing nutrients making them unavailable for plant uptake, and by creating physical and environmental conditions that can impede seedling establishment and survival. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the processes of humus formation and decomposition in order to manage these soils in a manner that will maintain or improve site productivity. This paper provides an overview of (i) the composition of humus, (ii) the conditions in the boreal forest that result in the surface accumulation of humus, (iii) decomposition processes and (iv) the effects of humus on nutrient (especially nitrogen) availability. Questions relating to the detrimental role of surface organic matter accumulation, the effects of natural disturbances (e.g., ®re) and harvesting disturbances on humus loss and accumulation and management practices that can maintain long-term site productivity will also be discussed. #},

Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data ($\sim$10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks (NNs).

   abstract = {Climate is the primary driver of the distribution of tree species worldwide, and the potential for adaptive evolution will be an important factor determining the response of forests to anthropogenic climate change. Although association mapping has the potential to improve our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of climatically relevant traits, the utility of adaptive polymorphisms uncovered by such studies would be greatly enhanced by the development of integrated models that account for the phenotypic effects of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their interactions simultaneously. We previously reported the results of association mapping in the widespread conifer Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). In the current study we used the recursive partitioning algorithm 'Random Forest' to identify optimized combinations of SNPs to predict adaptive phenotypes. After adjusting for population structure, we were able to explain 37% and 30% of the phenotypic variation, respectively, in two locally adaptive traits-autumn budset timing and cold hardiness. For each trait, the leading five SNPs captured much of the phenotypic variation. To determine the role of epistasis in shaping these phenotypes, we also used a novel approach to quantify the strength and direction of pairwise interactions between SNPs and found such interactions to be common. Our results demonstrate the power of Random Forest to identify subsets of markers that are most important to climatic adaptation, and suggest that interactions among these loci may be widespread. © 2012 Holliday et al.},

   abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

However, AGF may cause outbreeding depression (especially if source and recipient populations have been long isolated) and may disrupt local adaptation to nonclimatic factors. Selection should eliminate extrinsic outbreeding depression due to adaptive differences in large populations, and simulations suggest that, within a few generations, evolution should resolve mild intrinsic outbreeding depression due to epistasis. To weigh the risks of AGF against those of maladaptation due to climate change, we need to know the species' extent of local adaptation to climate and other environmental factors, as well as its pattern of gene flow.

Simulation models are being developed and used to project the effects of global climatic change, i.e., the greenhouse effect, on the dynamics and pattern of vegetation. Many models use information about species' current ranges relative to climatic variables, i.e., their realized niche, to derive response functions. Using a simulation model for Californian chaparral, we compare the projections of vegetation using response functions representing a calculated realized niche and an assumed fundamental niche. The realized niche response functions are based on the distributions of species along gradients of annual precipitation and mean temperatures of the coldest and warmest months. Then, assuming that moderate increases in precipitation (as projected by some general circulation models for Californian chaparral) will reduce stress, we modified the functions to produce assumed fundamental niche responses. Compared to the projections based on the realized niche, use of the fundamental niche produces more continuous cover, lags in change, and different dominance following climatic change. The effects of increased precipitation per se are lasting using the realized niche responses, but only temporary using the assumed fundamental niche responses. More detailed information on actual responses is needed, but the physiological information now available would be useful only in models that would consume vast computing resources.},

   abstract = {Projecting future distributions of ecosystems or species climate niches has widely been used to assess the potential impacts of climate change. However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We found that the degree-days below zero and mean annual precipitation were the most important climatic factors, while the basic soil saturation, soil gravel volume percentage, and clay content were the main soil factors, determining the suitable habitats of C. acuminata. We found that suitable habitats of this species would moderately increase in future climates under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. However, substantial shifts among levels of habitat suitability were projected. The dual high-suitable habitats would expand, which would be favorable for commercial plantations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of climate change on this species and provide a scientific basis for the cultivation and conservation purposes.},
