   abstract = {Diabetes is a very common and serious chronic disease, and one of the fastest growing disease burdens in the United States. Further, health behaviors, such as exercise, smoking, drinking, as well as weight status, are instrumental to diabetes management and the reduction of its medical consequences. Nine waves of the Health and Retirement Study are used to model the role of a recent diabetes diagnosis and medication on present and subsequent weight status, exercise, drinking and smoking activity. Several non-linear dynamic population average probit models are estimated. Results suggest that compared to non-diagnosed individuals at risk for high blood sugar, diagnosed diabetics respond initially in terms of increasing exercise, losing weight, and curbing smoking and drinking behavior, but the effect diminishes after diagnosis. Evidence of recidivism is also found in these outcomes, especially weight status and physical activity, suggesting that some behavioral responses to diabetes may be short-lived.},

Reasons given range from the lack of anticipated survival benefit from treatment to the inappropriateness of death as an anchor for valuing health states, or the increased value of time to the individual at the end of life. The Palliative Care Yardstick, has been proposed as an alternative. In this paper, I argue that the QALY should not be abandoned as an outcome measure in end of life and palliative care populations and suggest possible methods for generating empirical data to support or refute this. I show why the arguments made for replacement of the QALY are not supported by current evidence and how in some cases the abandonment of the QALY framework would lead to an unjustifiable inequitable distribution of resources.},

   abstract = {Expected longevity is an important factor influencing older individuals’ decisions such as consumption, savings, purchase of life insurance and annuities, claiming of Social Security benefits, and labor supply. It has also been shown to be a good predictor of actual longevity, which in turn is highly correlated with health status. A relatively new literature on health investments under uncertainty, which builds upon the seminal work by Grossman [Grossman, M., 1972. On the concept of health capital and demand for health. Journal of Political Economy 80, 223–255] has directly linked longevity with characteristics, behaviors, and decisions by utility maximizing agents. Our empirical model can be understood within that theoretical framework as estimating a production function of longevity. Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we directly incorporate health dynamics in explaining the variation in expected longevities, and compare two alternative measures of health dynamics: the self-reported health change, and the computed health change based on self-reports of health status. In 38% of the reports in our sample, computed health changes are inconsistent with the direct report on health changes over time. And another 15% of the sample can suffer from information losses if computed changes are used to assess changes in actual health. These potentially serious problems raise doubts regarding the use and interpretation of the computed health changes and even the lagged measures of self-reported health as controls for health dynamics in a variety of empirical settings. Our empirical results, controlling for both subjective and objective measures of health status and unobserved heterogeneity in reporting, suggest that self-reported health changes are a preferred measure of health dynamics.},

Methods: The Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFS) was administered by telephone to a stratified, random sample of health maintenance organization (HMO) subscribers in Colorado in 1993, and self-reports were compared with HMO medical records for 599 adults aged >21. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for three chronic conditions and use of six preventive services. Results: Sensitivity was highest for hypertension (83%), moderate for diabetes (73%), and lowest for hypercholesterolemia (59%); specificity was >80% for all three conditions. Sensitivity ranged from 86% to 99% for influenza immunization, clinical breast examination, blood cholesterol screening, mammography, Pap test, and blood pressure screening; specificity was <75% for all preventive services. Conclusions: Self-reports are reasonably accurate for certain chronic conditions and for routine screening exams and can provide a useful estimate for broad measures of population prevalence.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE:
To test the association of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes mellitus with education and income level. 

METHODS:
We utilized measures of diabetes status, fasting plasma glucose, socio-economic status, and demographic characteristics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) for adults of age 20 and older. We inferred the presence of undiagnosed diabetes using the criterion of the American Diabetes Association at the time of NHANES III. A logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of undiagnosed diabetes with education and income after controlling for other variables. 

RESULTS:
Undiagnosed diabetes is not related to education or income. In the sub-population of individuals with diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes is more likely in obese individuals (OR 1.95, 1.01–3.76), but is not related to education or income. 

CONCLUSIONS:
Socio-economic status, as measured by education and income, is not associated with whether or not individuals are likely to have undiagnosed diabetes. This finding suggests that screening for Type 2 diabetes should focus on those adults who are at risk for diabetes in general (based on age, racial/ethnic groups, obesity and other clinical risk factors) and that socio-economic characteristics are unlikely to provide further information.},

There was no consistent evidence of a decrease in smoking associated with statin use, and exercise worsened somewhat for females. Statin use was associated with increased physical activity among males. Finally, there was evidence that statin use increased the use of blood pressure medication and aspirin for both males and females, although estimates varied considerably in magnitude. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that healthy diet is a strong substitute for statins, but there is only uneven evidence for the hypothesis that investments in disease prevention are complementary.},

We utilize a nationally representative longitudinal data set of 4007 Taiwanese aged 60 or over and employ discrete-time duration models to investigate the association between annual mortality and its potential risk factors over a nearly twenty-year period (1989–2007). We place particular emphasis on the inherently dynamic character of Grossman's model, and specifically on how public and private health investment shape the personal health outcome over time. Our results support the hypothesis that depreciation rates depend on personal characteristics. In addition, we find that the dynamic profiles of both public and private health investment significantly influence the elderly mortality. An important implication of our study is that implementing universal health insurance and tobacco control programs are effective channels through which the government improves personal health.},

Although poor health and high inequality are key features of many developing countries, most of the earlier literature has drawn on data from developed countries in studying the association between the two. We find that self-reported health status increases with per capita income, but at a decreasing rate. Controlling for per capita income, we find an inverted-U association between self-reported health status and income inequality, which suggests that high inequality in a community poses threats to health. We also find that high inequality increases the probability of health-compromising behavior such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Most of our findings are robust to different measures of health status and income inequality. Journal of Comparative Economics 34 (4) (2006) 668–693.},

   abstract = {The volume and technical complexity of both academic and commercial research using decision analytic modeling has increased rapidly over the last 2 decades. The range of software used for their implementation has also increased, but it remains true that a small number of programs account for the vast majority of cost effectiveness modeling work. In this paper we report a head-to-head comparison of four programs to support researchers in identifying the most appropriate software for a given type of analysis. We find that whilst Excel and Treeage Pro are good programs for producing the types of analyses typically required by HTA agencies, and for educational purposes, the efficiency and transparency advantages of the programming languages MATLAB and R, become increasingly valuable when more complex analyses such as value of information, are required.},

   abstract = {This paper tests using survey data from China whether individual health is associated with income and community-level income inequality. Although poor health and high inequality are key features of many developing countries, most of the earlier literature has drawn on data from developed countries in studying the association between the two. We find that self-reported health status increases with per capita income, but at a decreasing rate. Controlling for per capita income, we find an inverted-U association between self-reported health status and income inequality, which suggests that high inequality in a community poses threats to health. We also find that high inequality increases the probability of health-compromising behavior such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Most of our findings are robust to different measures of health status and income inequality.

Catastrophic spending rates were highest in some countries in transition, and in certain Latin American countries. Three key preconditions for catastrophic payments were identified: the availability of health services requiring payment, low capacity to pay, and the lack of prepayment or health insurance. Interpretation: People, particularly in poor households, can be protected from catastrophic health expenditures by reducing a health system's reliance on out-of-pocket payments and providing more financial risk protection.

The other side of the coin, less well understood, is that many of those who do seek care suffer financial catastrophe and impoverishment as a result of meeting these costs. 2 This occurs in both rich and poor countries. 3 This paper focuses on the second effect-the financial consequences of paying for care. It begins by presenting new data from a large data set-116 surveys covering 89 countries-allowing the first global estimates of the extent of catastrophic spending and impoverishment associated with out-of-pocket payments for health services to be made. It then explores health system and population characteristics associated with high levels of catastrophic spending across countries, as the basis for assessing the policy options available to reduce the incidence of financial catastrophe. 4 Discussion and conclusions follow. 9 7 2 J u l y /A u g u s t 2 0 0 7},

   abstract = {There is currently considerable discussion between governments, international agencies, bilateral donors and advocacy groups on whether user fees levied at government health facilities in poor countries should be abolished. It is claimed that this would lead to greater access for the poor and reduce the risks of catastrophic health expenditures if all other factors remained constant, though other factors rarely remain constant in practice. Accordingly, it is important to understand what has actually happened when user fees have been abolished, and why. All fees at first level government health facilities in Uganda were removed in March 2001. This study explores the impact on health service utilization and catastrophic health expenditures using data from National Household Surveys undertaken in 1997, 2000 and 2003. Utilization increased for the non-poor, but at a lower rate than it had in the period immediately before fees were abolished. Utilization among the poor increased much more rapidly after the abolition of fees than beforehand. Unexpectedly, the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure among the poor did not fall. The most likely explanation is that frequent unavailability of drugs at government facilities after 2001 forced patients to purchase from private pharmacies. Informal payments to health workers may also have increased to offset the lost revenue from fees. Countries thinking of removing user charges should first examine what types of activities and inputs at the facility level are funded from the revenue collected by fees, and then develop mechanisms to ensure that these activities can be sustained subsequently.},

   abstract = {© 2015 Buigut et al.; licensee BioMed Central. Background: In Kenya, where 60 to 80% of the urban residents live in informal settlements (frequently referred to as slums), out-of-pocket (OOP) payments account for more than a third of national health expenditures. However, little is known on the extent to which these OOP payments are associated with personal or household financial catastrophe in the slums. This paper seeks to examine the incidence and determinants of catastrophic health expenditure among urban slum communities in Kenya. Methods: We use a unique dataset on informal settlement residents in Kenya and various approaches that relate households OOP payments for healthcare to total expenditures adjusted for subsistence, or income. We classified households whose OOP was in excess of a predefined threshold as facing catastrophic health expenditures (CHE), and identified the determinants of CHE using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The results indicate that the proportion of households facing CHE varies widely between 1.52% and 28.38% depending on the method and the threshold used. A core set of variables were found to be key determinants of CHE. The number of working adults in a household and membership in a social safety net appear to reduce the risk of catastrophic expenditure. Conversely, seeking care in a public or private hospital increases the risk of CHE. Conclusion: This study suggests that a substantial proportion of residents of informal settlements in Kenya face CHE and would likely forgo health care they need but cannot afford. Mechanisms that pool risk and cost (insurance) are needed to protect slum residents from CHE and improve equity in health care access and payment.},

   abstract = {Objectives: This study aims to identify the level of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) in Turkey and, to reveal household factors predicting this outcome. Methods: CHE is calculated from a national representative data derived from TurkStat, Household Budget Survey, Consumption Expenditures, 2006. The methods introduced by Ke Xu and colleagues are employed for calculations. Results: The proportion of households with CHE is 0.6%. Impoverished households consist 0.4% of total. Average out-of-pocket health payment is 7.36 USD (PPP$-2006) in lowest fifth that is approximately one tenth of the highest fifth (70.18 PPP USD-2006). In the logistic model, probability of facing CHE increases by each unit rise of per capita expenditure. Household head's health insurance is closely related with catastrophe. Rural households face 2.5 times more catastrophe than the urban area residents. Having preschool child in the household is seen as a protective factor for catastrophic expenditure. On the other hand, elderly or disabled person increases risk of catastrophe. Conclusions: Results indicate that more people in Turkey benefited from risk pooling/health insurance by 2006 and were, therefore, on average, better protected from catastrophic medical expenses, than in many other countries with comparable income levels at that time.},

Methods We used the Nouna Health District Household Survey to collect data on 800 households during 2000-01 for our analysis. The determinants of household catastrophic expenditure were identified by multivariate logistic regression method. Findings Even at very low levels of health care utilization and modest amount of health expenditure, 6-15% of total households in Nouna District incurred catastrophic health expenditure. The key determinants of catastrophic health expenditure were economic status, household health care utilization especially for modern medical care, illness episodes in an adult household member and presence of a member with chronic illness. Conclusion We conclude that the poorest members of the community incurred catastrophic health expenses. Setting only one threshold/cut-off value to determine catastrophic health expenses may result in inaccurate estimation leading to misinterpretation of important factors. Our findings have important policy implications and can be used to ensure better access to health services and a higher degree of financial protection for low-income groups against the economic impact of illness.},

   abstract = {Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate the proportion of households facing catastrophic health expenditures based on household income quintiles, and to analyze the relationship between expenditures and household income quintile decline. Methods: Study data were obtained from an annually conducted survey of the 2012-2013 Korean health panel. There were 12,909 subjects aged 20-64 years from economically active households, whose income quintile remained unchanged or declined by more than one quintile from 2012 to 2013. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether catastrophic health expenditures in 2012 were related to more than one quintile income decline in 2013. Results: Households facing catastrophic health expenditures of ≥ 40%, ≥ 30%, and ≥ 10% of a household's capacity to pay, were 1.58 times (p < 0.003), 1.75 times (p < 0.000), and 1.23 times (p < 0.001) more likely to face a decline in income quintile, respectively. Conclusion: Over a 1 year period, the proportion of households facing more than one quintile income decline was 16.4%, while 2.1% to 2.5% of households in Korea faced catastrophic health expenditures. Catastrophic health expenditure experienced in 2012 was significantly associated with income quintile decline 1 year later. Therefore, lowering the proportion of households with catastrophic health expenditure may reduce the proportion of households with income quintiles decline.},

This paper reviews studies that have measured the economic costs and consequences of illness for households, focusing on malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV/AIDS. It finds that in resource-poor settings illness imposed high and regressive cost burdens on patients and their families. Direct and indirect costs of illness for malaria were less than 10% of the household income, but still significant when combined with the costs of other illnesses. The costs of TB and HIV/AIDS were catastrophic for households (more than 10% of the income). Health service weaknesses in many countries, including low coverage, user charges, and poor quality of care, contributed to high costs. Poor households in developing countries with a member with TB or HIV/AIDS struggled to cope, highlighting the urgent need for a substantial increase in health sector investment to expand access to preventive and curative health services. Government and non-governmental interventions should also be broadened to encompass measures that reduce the substantial indirect costs associated with diseases such as malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS.},

The basic objective of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the effect of combining social health insurance (SHI) and private health insurance (PHI) on OOP payments. Further, this study examines the catastrophic impact of OOP payments on insured's welfare using the incidence and intensity methodological approach of measuring catastrophic health care expenditures. Conducting a cross-sectional survey in Greece in 2013, we find that the combination of SHI-PHI has a strong negative influence on insured OOP payments for inpatient health care in private hospitals. Furthermore, our results indicate that SHI coverage is not sufficient by itself to manage with this issue. Moreover, we find that poor people present a greater tendency to incur catastrophic OOP expenditures for hospital health care in private providers. Drawing evidence from Greece, a country with huge fiscal problems that has suffered the consequences of the economic crisis more than any other, could be a starting point for policymakers to consider the perspective of SHI-PHI cooperation against OOP payments more seriously.},

   abstract = {JEL classification: D12 D31 D80 I13 I15 Keywords: Medical expenditures Catastrophic payments Risk Reference-dependent utility Asia a b s t r a c t We propose a measure of household exposure to particularly onerous medical expenses. The measure can be decomposed into the probability that medical expenditure exceeds a threshold, the loss due to predictably low consumption of other goods if it does and the further loss arising from the volatility of medical expenses above the threshold. Depending on the choice of threshold, the measure is consistent with a model of reference-dependent utility with loss aversion. Unlike the risk premium, the measure is only sensitive to particularly high expenses, and can identify households that expect to incur such expenses and would benefit from subsidised, but not actuarially fair, insurance. An empirical illustration using data from seven Asian countries demonstrates the importance of taking account of informal insurance and reveals clear differences in catastrophic medical expenditure risk across and within countries. In general, risk is higher among poorer, rural and chronically ill populations.},

It does not discriminate between one situation in which the same households always spend a large proportion of their incomes on health care and no household faces risk, and another in which all households face a chance of spending excessively. <br/>Second, even if the probability of incurring so-called catastrophic medical expendtures is estimated for each household, this is still a very partial measure of risk. It is part of the expectation of particularly burdensome expenses and does not capture their variability (Gruber and Levy, 2009; National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2012). <br/>Third, while there are equity and efficiency arguments for relating coverage of a given medical expense to income, the frac- tion of income at which the catastrophic payments threshold is set is typically arbitrary and not easily reconciled with preferences. <br/>Fourth, there is no allowance for the exercise of informal insurance through saving and credit that may cushion the impact of out-of- pocket (OOP) medical expenses that are large in relation to income (Flores et al., 2008).},

   abstract = {Payment of user-fees for healthcare has negative consequences including catastrophic expenditures and reduction in utilization of healthcare services. Conversely, health insurance provides a means to protect against the financial risk associated with healthcare. This paper primarily investigates the effect of out-of-pocket payments (OPP) on the utilization of health services and the likelihood of exposure to catastrophic expenditure. Data was obtained from a household survey conducted in the Ga South Municipality. In all, 117 households consisting of 530 individuals were interviewed. In 55% of the households surveyed, at least one member had a valid health insurance policy against 45% with no insurance. Our finding from the multivariate regression shows that enrolment in health insurance has a negative and significant effect on out-of-pocket payment. Other significant pre-dictors of OPP were utilization and household per capita expenditure. Surprisingly, insurance status did not have a significant impact on utilization, as there was no significant difference between the insured and uninsured. However, per capita expenditure had a significant effect on utilization. Moreover, OPP and per capita expenditure had a significant effect on catastrophic expenditure. The paper concludes that health insurance is important in reducing out-of-pocket payments for healthcare but does not influence utilization of health services and exposure to catastrophic spending.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2002, the Chinese government launched a new rural health financing policy to provide health insurance (New Cooperative Medical Scheme, NCMS) for its rural population. NCMS, jointly financed by governments and individual households, aims to protect households from impoverishment due to catastrophic health expenditure. In 2011, NCMS covered more than 96% of the rural population. We have systematically searched and reviewed available evidence to estimate the effects of NCMS on health outcomes and on alleviating catastrophic health expenditure.\n\nMETHODS: PubMed, Web of Science with Conference Proceedings, ProQuest Digital Dissertations, CMCI, CNKI, and VIP were searched. We also obtained literature from colleague communications. Quasi-experimental studies regarding the effect of NCMS on health outcomes and catastrophic health expenditure were included. Two independent reviewers screened the literature, extracted the data, and assessed the study quality.\n\nRESULTS: Fifteen studies out of the 6123 studies in the literature fulfilled criteria and were included in this review. Twelve studies identified the relationship between NCMS and health outcomes, among which six studies measured sickness or injury in the past four weeks, four measured sickness or injury in the past two weeks, and five measured self-reported health status. Four studies focused on the relationship between NCMS and alleviating catastrophic health expenditure. However, the results from these studies were in conflict: individual studies indicated that NCMS had positive, negative, or no effect on health outcomes and/or the incidence of catastrophic health payments, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We still have no clear evidence that NCMS improves the health outcomes and decreases the alleviating catastrophic health expenditure of the China's rural population. In addition, the heterogeneity among individual studies reminds us that provider payment method reforms, benefit package and information systems around NCMS should be improved in the future.},

The financial data of all hospitalization cases from a sample hospital in 2013 were gathered and used to determine the pattern of household medical costs. A simulation model was constructed based on China’s current public health insurance system to evaluate the financial burden for medical service on Chinese patients, as well as to calculate the possibilities of CHE. Then, by adjusting several parameters, suggestions were made for China’s health insurance system in order to reduce CHE. It’s found with China’s current public health insurance system, the financial aid that a patient may receive depends on whether he is from an urban or rural area and whether he is employed. Due to the different insurance policies and the wide income gap between urban and rural areas, rural residents are much more financially vulnerable during health crisis. The possibility of CHE can be more than 50% for low-income rural families. The CHE ratio can be dramatically lowered by applying different policies for different household income groups. It’s concluded the financial burden for medical services of Chinese patients is quite large currently, especially for those from rural areas. By referencing different healthcare policies in the world, applying different health insurance policies for different income groups can dramatically reduce the possibility of CHE in China.},

The analysis is based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), a unique micro-level longitudinal survey of households in eight Chinese provinces. Findings indicate that while aggregate insurance coverage rates in the sample changed little over this period, certain previously noted differences in coverage rates across socioeconomic groups narrowed significantly. These findings bring into question the presumption that continued market-oriented reform would lead to increased differences in coverage across those groups. The results, in fact, suggest exactly the opposite, that as the market oriented changes have occurred important disparities in health insurance coverage have been reduced. If these reductions are occurring there are important implications for policy. The groups normally targeted for equity reasons seem to be making progress over time but continued improvements are needed for these groups to reach the levels of coverage enjoyed by more fortunate subgroups.},

Results of bivariate analyses show that medical insurance coverage, defined very broadly, varies considerably by individual and regional characteristics. Age, gender, education, occupation , employment sector, urbanization, level of industrial and commercial development, and province are all related to being insured or not. In addition, we find that the type of insurance program available to people varies by these same factors, and that the benefits provided by the seemingly uniform public and worker programs also vary, especially by province and degree of urban development. When the individual and regional variables are considered together in logistic regression analyses, the factors most strongly statistically related to the likelihood of being insured are where one works and where one lives. The distribution of insurance benefits in China appears to result in a pattern in which the rural and the poor, who are often at great risk of illness, are less likely to have medical insurance.},

Existing evidence on the results achieved by this reform in terms of reduction of out-of-pocket medical expenditures is still mixed and contradictory, and very little is known about the impact of these measures on the consumption and saving behavior of the Chinese population. To shed more light on this issue we use data collected in 1995 and 2002 by the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP). Contrary to previous evidence, our findings suggest that the effects of the reform have been more articulated and heterogeneous. In fact, we find that once properly accounting for income distribution and unobserved heterogeneity (potentially induced by health status), out-of-pocket medical expenses and saving rate are affected by the reform in a differentiated way. In particular, we find that out-of-pocket expenses decrease only for high income individuals with good health status and the saving rate increases only for low income individuals with good health status. This result is actually worrisome, as it suggests that the public health coverage after the reform provides financial protection only to individuals that are relatively better off (with good health status and/or high income).},

Using structural equation modeling, data on 1645 hospitalized patients obtained from a nationally representative survey in China are analyzed. The results show that the behavior management and purchasing mechanisms of SHI perform poorly, undermining the function of the reimbursement mechanism and mitigating the association between SHI participation and OOP. As a result, SHI participation has a weak negative or even no significant association with the OOP of hospitalized patients. This seems to contradict the principles of SHI, which aims to reduce people's OOP and enhance their wellbeing.

Our data cover 5.9 million people living in eight low-income rural counties, of which four adopted the NCMS by 2006 and four did not adopt it until 2007. Raw data suggest that enrolling in the NCMS is associated with better school enrollment and lower mortality of young children and pregnant women. However, using a difference-indifference propensity score method, we find that most of the differences are driven by endogenous introduction and take-up of the NCMS, and our method overcomes classical propensity score matching's failure to address selection bias.

   abstract = {China's economic reforms starting in the late 1970s have resulted in rapid economic growth, with annual growth in gross domestic product averaging greater than 10% per year for more than 30 years. Accompanying this rapid growth in national accounts have been rapid and widespread reductions in poverty. With these reductions in poverty, however, there has often been observed an increase in income inequality, both between as well as within rural and urban sectors. This rising income gap challenges the notion that economic reforms in China have been as successful as the poverty statistics would suggest. In this paper, we suggest that an alternative view would be to consider the effects of these reforms on changing the chronic nature of poverty and reducing household vulnerability to poverty. Using a balanced panel from rural China from 1991 through 2006, we find that most poverty among our sample has shifted from being chronic in nature to being transient, with households either shifting into a state of being non-poor moving in and out of poverty. Among our sample, vulnerability to poverty has been declining over time, but the declines are not uniform over time or space. We decompose household vulnerability status into two proximate causes: low expected income and high income variability, finding vulnerability increasingly due to income variability. Additionally, we demonstrate that vulnerable households have very different characteristics than non-vulnerable households.},

Introduction In 2009, China officially launched the New Health Care Reform (NHCR). One important purpose of the reform was to reduce financial burden of health care through health insurance expansion and health care provider regulations. This study aimed to provide evidence on the effect of the NHCR reform on catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) by comparing the occurrence and inequality of CHE among households with chronic diseases patients before and after the reform. Methods This study used the subset of data from the 2008 and 2013 National Health Services Survey conducted in Shaanxi Province. Our sample included households with chronic diseases patients and excluded observations with key variables missing. The final sample size was 1942 households in 2008 and 7704 households in 2013. We defined CHE occurrence following the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO). The income-related inequality in CHE was measured by the concentration index. A multi-level logistic regression model was used in the study to explore the influence of the NHCR on CHE occurrence, controlling for important covariates. Results From 2008 to 2013, the occurrence rate of CHE in rural areas declined from 29.15% to 23.62%. However, the CHE rate in urban areas increased from 19.18% to 24.95%. The interaction term between year and rural/urban location was statistically significant, confirming that the influence of the NHCR on the CHE occurrence rates were heterogeneous between rural and urban areas. As for the CHE inequality, the concentration index in rural areas decreased from -0.4572 to -0.5499 with a p-value less than 0.05. This implied that the CHE occurrence inequality was increased after the implementation of the NHCR. Conclusion Our study suggested that the implementation of the NHCR might not have been effective in reducing the CHE occurrence for households with chronic disease patients. Although the occurrence of CHE of rural households had decreased, the occurrence of CHE in urban areas was higher than before. In addition, the income inequality of CHE occurrence was greater in 2013 compared to that in 2008 in rural areas. Although the reform resulted in higher insurance coverage and higher government expenditure in health care, the financial burden of health care on households did not necessarily improve. Further efforts on developing the current health insurance system and optimizing the hierarchical health care system are required to improve the protection against CHE.},

   abstract = {China has achieved significant achievements in poverty reduction since the launch of its reform and opening policy in 1978. The rural poor population decreased by nearly 67 million from 2010 to 2012. Analysing and understanding the spatio-temporal variation of poverty alleviation performance in contiguous poverty-stricken regions can provide a reference for Chinese policymakers. In this paper, based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we build an evaluation index system of poverty alleviation performance and then establish a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to explore the space–time variability of poverty alleviation performance in poor areas. The spatial distribution indicates the eastern region’s higher performance in poverty alleviation compared to the western region. The spatial–temporal feature shows that the increasing trend of poverty alleviation performance presents a pattern of “high in the central, low in the east–west” and most poor counties’ development of poverty alleviation performance are consistent with overall trend. These findings suggest that the government could pay more attention to the development in the western region and vigorously carry out precise poverty alleviation measures.},

   abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to produce a high-quality measure of the nature of healthcare resources available in China's Township Health Centers (THCs), paying particular attention to equity between high-and low-income areas. Design/methodology/approach - This study makes use of data from a nearly nationally representative survey in rural China conducted by the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011. The samples of towns were selected randomly from 25 counties located in five provinces from different regions of China. Data were collected through questionnaires and direct observation. Findings - The THCs located in rich areas have higher levels of human resources than poor areas. THCs in rich areas also have more fixed assets than those in poor areas. In fact, even though the Chinese Ministry of Health mandates that all THCs have certain basic levels of medical equipment and facilities, many THCs in poor areas do not have them. The allocation of mandated equipment is unequal. Practical implications - These findings suggest that China's government should pay more attention to THCs located in poor areas, especially in light of new initiatives to improve health care in poor rural areas. Originality/value - This is the first nationally representative study to employ rigorous empirics to investigate the extent of inequality in allocation of resources within THCs across China.},

This article reports on findings from a longitudinal study of how the program affected the use of health care services, out-of-pocket spending on medical care, and the operations and financial viability of China's township health centers, which constitute a middle tier of care in between village clinics and county hospitals. We found that between 2005 and 2008 the program provided some risk protection and increased the intensity of inpatient care at township health centers. Importantly, the program appears to have improved the centers' financial status. At the same time, the program did not increase the overall number of patients served or the likelihood that a sick person would seek care at a township center. These findings serve as a benchmark of the program's early impact. The results also suggest that the composition of health care use in China has changed, with people increasingly seeking outpatient care at village clinics and inpatient care at township health centers.},

   abstract = {One-fifth of nonelderly adults in the United States lacked health insurance coverage in 2005. Most of these were from lower-income families, and nearly one-half were African American or Hispanic (Carmen DeNavas-Walt, Bernadette Proctor, and Cheryl Hill Lee 2005). Many analysts have argued that unequal insurance coverage contributes to disparities in health care utilization and health outcomes across socioeconomic groups. Even among the insured there are differences in copayments, deductibles, and other features that affect service use. Nevertheless, credible evidence that better insurance causes better health outcomes is limited (M. E. Brown, A. B. Bineman, and N. Lurie 1998; Helen Levy and David Meltzer 2001). Both the supply and demand for insurance depend on health status, confounding observational comparisons between people with different insurance characteristics. In contrast to the heterogeneity among the nonelderly, fewer than 1 percent of the elderly popu-lation are uninsured, and most have fee-for-service Medicare coverage. The transition occurs abruptly at age 65, the threshold for Medicare eligibility. Building on this fact, in this paper we use a regression-discontinuity framework to compare health-related outcomes among people just before and just after the age of 65. Our analysis extends existing research on the effects of the age 65 threshold (Frank R. Lichtenberg, 2002; William H. Dow 2003; Sandra Decker and Carol Rapaport 2002a; Decker 2002; Decker and Rapaport 2000b; J. Michael McWilliams et al. 2003) in two main ways. First, we examine a wider range of outcomes. We use survey data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to analyze changes in self-reported access to care, and in the number of recent doctor visits and hospital stays. We supplement these data with hospital discharge records from California, Florida, and New York, which allow us to measure changes in hospital admissions for specific conditions and procedures, and by hospital type. Second, we focus on the differential effects of Medicare eligibility on different subgroups, and use the pat-tern of intergroup differences to assess whether these impacts arise through changes in insurance coverage, insurance generosity, or other channels. We also quantify the extent to which the onset of Medicare eligibility reduces or increases disparities in use of different types of services. Our main finding is that Medicare eligibility causes a sharp increase in the use of health care services, with a pattern of gains across groups that varies by the type of service. For relatively low-cost services, such as routine doctor visits, the onset of Medicare eligibility leads to increases in utilization that are concentrated among groups with the lowest rates of insurance coverage},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree to which the Chinese people are protected from catastrophic household expenditure and impoverishment from medical expenses and to explore the health system and structural factors influencing the first of these outcomes. METHODS: Data were derived from the Fourth National Health Service Survey. An analysis of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment from medical expenses was undertaken with a sample of 55 556 households of different characteristics and located in rural and urban settings in different parts of the country. Logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure. FINDINGS: The rate of catastrophic health expenditure was 13.0%; that of impoverishment was 7.5%. Rates of catastrophic health expenditure were higher among households having members who were hospitalized, elderly, or chronically ill, as well as in households in rural or poorer regions. A combination of adverse factors increased the risk of catastrophic health expenditure. Families enrolled in the urban employee or resident insurance schemes had lower rates of catastrophic health expenditure than those enrolled in the new rural corporative scheme. The need for and use of health care, demographics, type of benefit package and type of provider payment method were the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure. CONCLUSION: Although China has greatly expanded health insurance coverage, financial protection remains insufficient. Policy-makers should focus on designing improved insurance plans by expanding the benefit package, redesigning cost sharing arrangements and provider payment methods and developing more effective expenditure control strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND The goal of universal health coverage (UHC) requires inter alia that families who get needed health care do not suffer undue financial hardship as a result. This can be measured by the percentage of people in households whose out-of-pocket health expenditures are large relative to their income or consumption. We aimed to estimate the global incidence of catastrophic health spending, trends between 2000 and 2010, and associations between catastrophic health spending and macroeconomic and health system variables at the country level. METHODS We did a retrospective observational study of health spending using data obtained from household surveys. Of 1566 potentially suitable household surveys, 553 passed quality checks, covering 133 countries between 1984 and 2015. We defined health spending as catastrophic when it exceeded 10% or 25% of household consumption. We estimated global incidence by aggregating up from every country, using a survey for the year in question when available, and interpolation and model-based estimates otherwise. We used multiple regression to explore the relation between a country's incidence of catastrophic spending and gross domestic product (GDP) per person, the Gini coefficient for income inequality, and the share of total health expenditure spent by social security funds, other government agencies, private insurance schemes, and non-profit institutions. FINDINGS The global incidence of catastrophic spending at the 10% threshold was estimated as 9·7% in 2000, 11·4% in 2005, and 11·7% in 2010. Globally, 808 million people in 2010 incurred catastrophic health spending. Across 94 countries with two or more survey datapoints, the population-weighted median annual rate of change of catastrophic payment incidence was positive whatever catastrophic payment incidence measure was used. Incidence of catastrophic payments was correlated positively with GDP per person and the share of GDP spent on health, and incidence correlated negatively with the share of total health spending channelled through social security funds and other government agencies. INTERPRETATION The proportion of the population that is supposed to be covered by health insurance schemes or by national or subnational health services is a poor indicator of financial protection. Increasing the share of GDP spent on health is not sufficient to reduce catastrophic payment incidence; rather, what is required is increasing the share of total health expenditure that is prepaid, particularly through taxes and mandatory contributions.

Yet, economists have to date failed to reach an agreement on what the main determinants of this development are. This paper revisits Baumol's [Baumol, W.J., 1967. Macroeconomics of unbalanced growth: the anatomy of urban crisis. American Economic Review 57 (3), 415–426] model of ‘unbalanced growth’, showing that the latter offers a ready explanation for the observed inexorable rise in health care expenditure. The main implication of Baumol's model in this context is that health care expenditure is driven by wage increases in excess of productivity growth. This hypothesis is tested empirically using data from a panel of 19 OECD countries. Our tests yield robust evidence in favor of Baumol's theory.},

   abstract = {To combat adverse selection, governments increasingly base payments to health plans and providers on enrollees' scores from risk-adjustment formulae. In 2004, Medicare began to risk-adjust capitation payments to private Medicare Advantage (MA) plans to reduce selection-driven overpayments. But because the variance of medical costs increases with the predicted mean, incentivizing enrollment of individuals with higher scores can increase the scope for enrolling "overpriced" individuals with costs significantly below the formula's prediction. Indeed, after risk adjustment, MA plans enrolled individuals with higher scores but lower costs conditional on their score. We find no evidence that overpayments were on net reduced. (JEL G22, H51, I13, I18) Recent health care reforms have attempted to move away from the fee-for-service (FFS) payment model-which economists have long argued incentivizes over-provision of services-by paying providers or insurers fixed capitation payments rather than reimbursing them for each service. The success of such reforms hinges on correctly aligning capitation payments with a patient's expected cost. Otherwise, plans and providers will have incentives to cream skim overpriced cases instead of competing on quality or cost. To more accurately equate payments with expected costs, governments and other insurance sponsors have increasingly turned to "risk adjustment"-setting payments to insurers or providers to take account of an individual's past and current health conditions. For example, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) relies heavily on},

   abstract = {China's 3 year, CN¥850 billion (US$125 billion) reform plan, launched in 2009, marked the first phase towards achieving comprehensive universal health coverage by 2020. The government's undertaking of systemic reform and its affirmation of its role in financing health care together with priorities for prevention, primary care, and redistribution of finance and human resources to poor regions are positive developments. Accomplishing nearly universal insurance coverage in such a short time is commendable. However, transformation of money and insurance coverage into cost-effective services is difficult when delivery of health care is hindered by waste, inefficiencies, poor quality of services, and scarcity and maldistribution of the qualified workforce. China must reform its incentive structures for providers, improve governance of public hospitals, and institute a stronger regulatory system, but these changes have been slowed by opposition from stakeholders and lack of implementation capacity. The pace of reform should be moderated to allow service providers to develop absorptive capacity. Independent, outcome-based monitoring and evaluation by a third-party are essential for mid-course correction of the plans and to make officials and providers accountable. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The German risk adjustment mechanism is used only within the public system. It was introduced in two steps, 1994 and 1995. Because of the income-related contribution, which the insured pay directly to their sickness fund, income of the insured is equalized by the mechanism and causes the biggest part of the payments among the sickness funds. On the expenditure side age, gender, disability and entitlement for sickness allowances are used as risk adjusters. The mechanism is retrospective, calculating average costs for each of the 670 risk cells defined by the risk adjusters and using these ''standardized expenditures'' as a base for the payment a single sickness fund gets because of its risk structure. There do still exist incentives for risk selection. The experience shows that mostly the young and healthy are willing to change sickness funds motivated by lower contribution rates. This can be used and is used for self-selection. Another cause of risk selection is regional differences. The central suggestion of an expertise on behalf of the German Ministry of Health on experiences and improvement proposals is the change to a direct modeling of morbidity.},

To date, there has been no investigation of the effects of outdoor pollution on infant mortality in the UK. METHODS Daily time-series data of air pollution and all infant deaths between 1990 and 2000 in 10 major cities of England: Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield, were analysed. City-specific estimates were pooled across cities in a fixed-effects meta-regression to provide a mean estimate. RESULTS Few associations were observed between infant deaths and most pollutants studied. The exception was sulphur dioxide (SO2), of which a 10 mug/m(3) increase was associated with a RR of 1.02 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.04) in all infant deaths. The effect was present in both neonatal and postneonatal deaths. CONCLUSIONS Continuing reductions in SO2 levels in the UK may yield additional health benefits for infants.},

METHODS Statistical variables in medicine may be of either the metric (continuous, quantitative) or categorical (nominal, ordinal) type. Easily understandable examples are given. Basic techniques for the statistical description of collected data are presented and illustrated with examples. RESULTS The goal of a scientific study must always be clearly defined. The definition of the target value or clinical endpoint determines the level of measurement of the variables in question. Nearly all variables, whatever their level of measurement, can be usefully presented graphically and numerically. The level of measurement determines what types of diagrams and statistical values are appropriate. There are also different ways of presenting combinations of two independent variables graphically and numerically. CONCLUSIONS The description of collected data is indispensable. If the data are of good quality, valid and important conclusions can already be drawn when they are properly described. Furthermore, data description provides a basis for inferential statistics.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION An interrupted time series (ITS) design is an important observational design used to examine the effects of an intervention or exposure. This design has particular utility in public health where it may be impracticable or infeasible to use a randomised trial to evaluate health system-wide policies, or examine the impact of exposures (such as earthquakes). There have been relatively few studies examining the design characteristics and statistical methods used to analyse ITS designs. Further, there is a lack of guidance to inform the design and analysis of ITS studies.This is the first study in a larger project that aims to provide tools and guidance for researchers in the design and analysis of ITS studies. The objectives of this study are to (1) examine and report the design characteristics and statistical methods used in a random sample of contemporary ITS studies examining public health interventions or exposures that impact on health-related outcomes, and (2) create a repository of time series data extracted from ITS studies. Results from this study will inform the remainder of the project which will investigate the performance of a range of commonly used statistical methods, and create a repository of input parameters required for sample size calculation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will collate 200 ITS studies evaluating public health interventions or the impact of exposures. ITS studies will be identified from a search of the bibliometric database PubMed between the years 2013 and 2017, combined with stratified random sampling. From eligible studies, we will extract study characteristics, details of the statistical models and estimation methods, effect metrics and parameter estimates. Further, we will extract the time series data when available. We will use systematic review methods in the screening, application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extraction of data. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise the data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required since information will only be extracted from published studies. Dissemination of the results will be through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences. A repository of data extracted from the published ITS studies will be made publicly available.},

While a number of studies have exploited this type of data to distinguish transitory from more chronic forms of income or expenditure poverty, this paper develops an asset-based approach to poverty analysis that makes it possible to distinguish deep-rooted, persistent structural poverty from poverty that passes naturally with time due to systemic growth processes. Drawing on the economic theory of poverty traps and bifurcated accumulation strategies, this paper briefly discusses some feasible estimation strategies for empirically identifying poverty traps and long-term, persistent structural poverty, as well as relevant extensions of the popular Foster-Greer-Thorbecke class of poverty measures. The paper closes with reflections on how asset-based poverty can be used to underwrite the design of persistent poverty reduction strategies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Monitoring the incidence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditure, as well as the impoverishing effects of out of pocket costs to access healthcare, is a key part of benchmarking Kenya's progress towards reducing the financial burden that households experience when accessing healthcare. METHODS The study relies on data from the nationally-representative Kenya Household Expenditure and Utilization Survey conducted in 2013 (n =33,675). We undertook health equity analysis to estimate the incidence and intensity of catastrophic expenditure. Households were considered to have incurred catastrophic expenditures if their annual out of-pocket health expenditures exceeded 40% of their annual non-food expenditure. We assessed the impoverishing effects of out of pocket payments using the Kenya national poverty line. We distinguished between direct payments for healthcare such as payments for consultation, medicines, medical procedures, and total healthcare expenditure that includes direct healthcare payments and the cost of transportation to and from health facilities. We used logistic regression analysis to explore the factors associated with the incidence of catastrophic expenditures. RESULTS When only direct payments to healthcare providers were considered, the incidence of catastrophic expenditures was 4.52%. When transport costs are included, the incidence of catastrophic expenditure increased to 6.58%. 453,470 Kenyans are pushed into poverty annually as a result of direct payments for healthcare. When the cost of transport is included, that number increases by more than one third to 619,541. Unemployment of the household head, presence of an elderly person, a person with a chronic ailment, a large household size, lower household social-economic status, and residence in marginalized regions of the country are significantly associated with increased odds of incurring catastrophic expenditures. CONCLUSIONS Kenyan policy makers should prioritize extending pre-payment mechanisms to more vulnerable groups, specifically the poor, the elderly, those suffering from chronic ailments and those living in marginalized regions of the country. The range of services covered under these mechanisms should also be extended such that the proportion of direct costs paid to access care is reduced. Policy makers should also prioritize reducing supply side bottlenecks such as availability of healthcare facilities in close proximity to the population, especially in rural and marginalized areas, and improvements in quality of care. For the poor and the vulnerable, initiatives to cover the cost of transport to and from a health facility, such as transport vouchers could also be explored.},

   abstract = {Equity has long been considered an important goal in the health sector. Yet inequalities\nbetween the poor and the better-off persist. The poor tend to suffer higher\nrates of mortality and morbidity than do the better-off. They often use health services\nless, despite having higher levels of need. And, notwithstanding their lower\nlevels of utilization, the poor often spend more on health care as a share of income\nthan the better-off. Indeed, some nonpoor households may be made poor precisely\nbecause of health shocks that necessitate out-of-pocket spending on health.\nMost commentators accept that these inequalities refl ect mainly differences in\nconstraints between the poor and the better-off - lower incomes, higher time costs,\nless access to health insurance, living conditions that are more likely to encourage\nthe spread of disease, and so on - rather than differences in preferences (cf. e.g.,\nAlleyne et al. 2000; Braveman et al. 2001; Evans et al. 2001a; Le Grand 1987; Wagstaff\n2001; Whitehead 1992). Such inequalities tend therefore to be seen not simply as\ninequalities but as inequities (Wagstaff and van Doorslaer 2000).\nSome commentators, including Nobel prize winners James Tobin (1970) and\nAmartya Sen (2002), argue that inequalities in health are especially worrisome -\nmore worrisome than inequalities in most other spheres. Health and health care\nare integral to people’s capability to function -their ability to fl ourish as human\nbeings. As Sen puts it, "Health is among the most important conditions of human\nlife and a critically signifi cant constituent of human capabilities which we have reason\nto value" (Sen 2002). Society is not especially concerned that, say, ownership\nof sports utility vehicles is low among the poor. But it is concerned that poor children\nare systematically more likely to die before they reach their fi fth birthday and\nthat the poor are systematically more likely to develop chronic illnesses. Inequalities\nin out-of-pocket spending matter too, because if the poor - through no fault\nof their own - are forced into spending large amounts of their limited incomes on\nhealth care, they may well end up with insuffi cient resources to feed and shelter\nthemselves.},

The paper contributes to the empirical analysis of poverty trap by investigating the presence of one potential poverty trap to simultaneous poverty trap. The paper uses the India Human Development Survey for the year 1993 and 2005. We use the local polynomial regression with Epanechnikov kernel weights to test the existence of multiple or single equilibrium in asset poverty dynamics. Moreover, we use the partial linear mixed model to test the impact of illiteracy trap and under-nutrition trap on asset dynamics process. Across all the States we find only single dynamic asset equilibrium for rural households. However the nature of the asset dynamics varies from one state to another. We find that, in most of the States, asset accumulation does not take place and welfare dynamics is very poor in rural areas. Further, we find under-nutrition trap uniformly affect the asset accumulation in most of the States. However an illiteracy trap affects the asset level heterogeneously over the income and regional distribution. We find the most deprived States (Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh) have the multiple poverty trap compared to richer States. Our result implies that asset dynamics of the household varies in the long term according to the types of traps. Government and policy makers should take pointed policy and programme based on whether the poor are trapped and in what ways. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Hence, a gloomy future induces the agent to shorten her time horizon in order to reduce distress caused by the anticipation of poverty, at the cost of worsening her realized future consumption, resulting in a behavioral poverty trap where poverty and shortsightedness reinforce each other. The paper also provides primary empirical evidence of the endogenous determination of time horizon and of the existence of a behavioral poverty trap. Using a randomized controlled trial in Mozambique that provided agro-input subsidies and a Matched Savings program, I show that improvement in economic prospects resulted in a significant increase in the planning horizon of the poor beneficiaries. Moreover, the increase in horizon significantly predicts asset accumulation of beneficiaries during the two years following the intervention.},

This paper reassesses the intertemporal asset management problem with a poverty trap model and shows that we would expect to see asset smoothing, not consumption smoothing, in the neighborhood of critical asset levels at which optimal accumulation behavior bifurcates. We then employ threshold estimation techniques to empirically confirm the co-existence of consumption and asset smoothing regimes using a household panel data set from West Africa. Households above the estimated threshold almost completely insulate their consumption from weather shocks, whereas those below the threshold do not.

This study uses modern validation methods to assess the item and test characteristics of the OAB-v8, and determine whether it should be scored differently for men and women. METHODS A secondary analysis of data from patients with lower urinary tract symptoms prospectively recruited from a urology clinic in Calgary, Canada. Item-response theory (IRT) was used to evaluate the dimensionality, reliability, and validity of the OAB-v8, and differential functioning analysis (DIF) was used to determine whether the OAB-v8 should be scored differently for men and women. RESULTS A total of 1128 patients were included for analysis, of which 28% were female. Mean OAB-v8 scores indicated meaningful levels of symptom bother, and women scored 2 points higher, on average, than men (P = 0.005). Reliability was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.901) for a wide range of patients (between -2 and 2.5 standard deviations of the mean). Samejima's graded response model best fit the data, and the scale demonstrated essential unidimensionality. Items #5 and #6 were excessively correlated. There was no evidence of differential functioning. CONCLUSIONS OAB-v8 demonstrated high reliability and would be appropriate for a wide range of patients. Items #5 and #6 may need to be re-worded. The OAB-v8 should not be scored differently for men and women, although women do appear to experience higher average levels of symptom bother from OAB than men.},

This study assesses the Stoma-QOL's overall and item-level psychometric characteristics in patients with temporary stomas, and whether stoma-related quality of life differs by demographic characteristics. Materials and methods: Analysis of cross-sectional observational PRO data from hospitals in Vancouver, Canada. Patients registered for elective ileostomy or colostomy closure, over the age of 18, and able to read English were eligible for participation. Emergent and cancer-related cases were excluded. One-way analysis of variance was used to test for demographic differences in Stoma-QOL scores. Cronbach's alpha was used for reliability, and Rasch item-response theory was used to assess overall and item characteristics. Results: 120 patients were included. No statistically significant difference in Stoma-QOL scores was found by age, sex, or socioeconomic status. Reliability was 0.93. Mean item responses ranged from 1.77 to 3.55 and item-total correlation ranged from 0.51 to 0.77. The Rasch item-response theory model demonstrated significant misfit, likely due to the misfit of item 9, which asks about sexuality, and high residual correlations between item pairs 6 and 8 about fatigue, and items 16 and 17 about social relationships. Conclusions: The Stoma-QOL questionnaire is a well-designed PRO for measuring stoma-related quality of life. Demographic variables do not appear to have a strong influence on Stoma-QOL scores. Item 9 demonstrated misfit but removal likely does not improve the instrument. Future research should focus on revising items 6, 8, 16, and 17. ARTICLE HISTORY},

Evaluations of this instrument are limited, restraining user's confidence in the instrument. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the ICIQ-UI-SF on a sample of urological surgery patients in Canada. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven surgical patients with stress urinary incontinence completed the ICIQ-UI-SF pre-operatively. Methods drawing from confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), measures of reliability, item response theory (IRT), and differential item functioning were applied. Ceiling effects were examined. RESULTS: Ceiling effects were identified. In the CFA, the factor loadings of items one and two differed significantly (p < 0.001) from item three indicating possible multidimensionality. The first two items reflect symptom severity not quality of life. Reliability was moderate as measured by Cronbach's alpha (0.63) and McDonald's coefficient (0.65). The IRT found the instrument does not discriminate between individuals with low incontinence-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Due to low/moderate reliability, the ICIQ-UI-SF can be used as a complement to other data or used to report aggregated surgical outcomes among surgical patients. If the primary objective is to measure quality of life, other PROs should be considered.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND The 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) is a widely applied patient-reported outcome instrument used to assess the severity of symptoms associated with chronic rhinosinusitis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the measurement performance of the SNOT-22 instrument on an item-level basis, in a sample of patients awaiting elective surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis. METHODS This study involved secondary analysis of SNOT-22 data that was prospectively collected from patients diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis and awaiting endoscopic sinus surgery in Vancouver, Canada. This study used classic test theory and a 2-parameter graded-response model to evaluate the SNOT-22 items' abilities to measure the severity of chronic rhinosinusitis in terms of patients' self-reported symptoms. This approach models each item's discriminability and difficulty, which provides insight into how well they respectively measure symptoms related to chronic rhinosinusitis. RESULTS Factor analyses indicated that there are 5 domains of measurement in the SNOT-22. The majority of items demonstrated strong discriminability between symptom severities. Likewise, most of the items demonstrated strong difficulty measuring the symptoms across their range of levels. The exception was those items related to psychological symptoms. Differential item functioning demonstrated that very few of the SNOT-22 items were answered significantly differently by gender or age subgroups. CONCLUSION This item-level analysis demonstrates that, in general, the SNOT-22 is a strong instrument. Items related to psychological symptoms require further investigation and warrant a supplemental patient-reported outcome instrument.},

   abstract = {Administrative health care databases offer an efficient and accessible, though as-yet unvalidated, approach to studying outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The objective of this study is to determine the validity of outpatient physician billing derived algorithms for defining chronic dialysis compared to a reference standard ESRD registry. A cohort of incident dialysis patients (Jan. 1 - Dec. 31, 2008) and prevalent chronic dialysis patients (Jan 1, 2008) was selected from a geographically inclusive ESRD registry and administrative database. Four administrative data definitions were considered: at least 1 outpatient claim, at least 2 outpatient claims, at least 2 outpatient claims at least 90 days apart, and continuous outpatient claims at least 90 days apart with no gap in claims greater than 21 days. Measures of agreement of the four administrative data definitions were compared to a reference standard (ESRD registry). Basic patient characteristics are compared between all 5 patient groups. 1,118,097 individuals formed the overall population and 2,227 chronic dialysis patients were included in the ESRD registry. The three definitions requiring at least 2 outpatient claims resulted in kappa statistics between 0.60-0.80 indicating "substantial" agreement. "At least 1 outpatient claim" resulted in "excellent" agreement with a kappa statistic of 0.81. Of the four definitions, the simplest (at least 1 outpatient claim) performed comparatively to other definitions. The limitations of this work are the billing codes used are developed in Canada, however, other countries use similar billing practices and thus the codes could easily be mapped to other systems. Our reference standard ESRD registry may not capture all dialysis patients resulting in some misclassification. The registry is linked to on-going care so this is likely to be minimal. The definition utilized will vary with the research objective.},

   abstract = {Purpose-Measuring prostate cancer patient HRQOL in routine clinical practice is hindered by lack of instruments enabling efficient real-time, point-of-care scoring of multiple HRQOL domains. We sought to develop an instrument for this purpose. Materials and Methods-The EPIC for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) is a one-page, 16-item questionnaire to measure urinary incontinence, urinary irritation, bowel, sexual, and hormonal HRQOL domains that we constructed by eliminating conceptually overlapping items from the 3 page EPIC-26, and revising the questionnaire format to mirror the AUA Symptom Index, thereby enabling practitioners to calculate HRQOL scores at point of care. We administered EPIC-CP to a new cohort of PCa patients in community-based and academic oncology, radiation, and urology practices to evaluate the instrument's validity and ease of use for clinical practice. Results-175 treated and 132 untreated PCa subjects completed EPIC-CP (N = 307). EPIC-CP domain scores correlated highly with respective domain scores from longer versions of EPIC (r ≥ 0.93 for all domains). EPIC-CP showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's ó-= 0.64-0.84) and sensitivity to PCa treatment-related effects (p < 0.05 in each of 5 HRQOL domains). Patients completed EPIC-CP efficiently (96% in <10 minutes, and 11% missing items). It was deemed 'very convenient' by clinicians in 87% of routine clinical encounters, and clinicians accurately scored completed questionnaires 94% of the time. Conclusions-EPIC-CP is a valid instrument that enables patient-reported HRQOL to be measured efficiently and accurately at the point of care, and can thereby facilitate improved emphasis and management of patient-reported outcomes.},

For meaningful comparisons across groups, it is important to identify items on such scales that exhibit differential item functioning (DIF). In this study, the authors examined several methods for assessing DIF on polytomous items generated by an ideal point process. Two paradigms (i.e., null hypothesis significance testing [NHST] and effect size quantification) were utilized, and three test statistics (i.e., the log-likelihood ratio [LR], the Akaike information criterion [AIC], and Lord’s chi-square) and two approaches to DIF testing (i.e., the constrained and free baseline methods) were evaluated. In addition, the authors investigated three levels of impact. The results revealed that DIF effect sizes were moderately large for the .50 uniform DIF conditions and small for nonuniform DIF; moreover, the LR test in general yielded the best results. When there was small to moderate impact, the free baseline approach combined with an item linking implementation produced the most satisfactory results.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of administrative data for pharmacoepidemiologic research on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has become increasingly popular. Although large sample sizes and ease of accessibility have made electronic health data an attractive data option, the risk of inaccurate cohort identification can lead to biased outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this systematic review were to (1) report current case definitions for CRS used in administrative data base research, and (2) define the various administrative data bases used for CRS research. METHODS: Medical literature data bases were searched from the date of their inception to February 1, 2015. Included studies were publications that obtained CRS-specific data from a health records data base. Studies were excluded if they evaluated a non-CRS cohort, failed to use or report an international classification of disease (ICD) code in the case definition, or published in a non-peer-reviewed journal. RESULTS: Of the 27 studies that met inclusion criteria, 8 different CRS case definitions were identified and 13 administrative data bases were evaluated. Of the 8 different CRS case definitions identified, only one was validated. The most commonly used CRS case definition was the ICD-9 473.x code alone. CONCLUSION: To optimize the accuracy of pharmacoepidemiologic research for CRS that used administrative data, it is important to apply appropriate case definitions for CRS. Various nonvalidated CRS case definitions are currently being used in administrative data base research. There is a need to develop a generalizable and validated ICD-based CRS case definition to increase the accuracy of future pharmacoepidemiologic research.},

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a generalizable administrative database case definition for CRS using International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9)-coded claims. METHODS: A random sample of 100 patients with a guideline-based diagnosis of CRS and 100 control patients were selected and then linked to a Canadian physician claims database from March 31, 2010, to March 31, 2015. The proportion of CRS ICD-9-coded claims (473.x and 471.x) for each of these 200 patients were reviewed and the validity of 7 different ICD-9-based coding algorithms was evaluated. RESULTS: The CRS case definition of >/=2 claims with a CRS ICD-9 code (471.x or 473.x) within 2 years of the reference case provides a balanced validity with a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 79%. Applying this CRS case definition to the claims database produced a CRS cohort of 51,000 patients with characteristics that were consistent with published demographics and rates of comorbid asthma, allergic rhinitis, and depression. CONCLUSION: This study has validated several coding algorithms; based on the results a case definition of >/=2 physician claims of CRS (ICD-9 of 471.x or 473.x) within 2 years provides an optimal level of validity. Future studies will need to validate this administrative case definition from different health system perspectives and using larger retrospective chart reviews from multiple providers.},

This paper introduces the basic premise, assumptions, and methods of IRT. To help explain these concepts we generate a hypothetical scale using three items from a modified, binary (yes/no) response version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale that was administered to 19,399 respondents. We first conducted a factor analysis to confirm the unidimensionality of the three items and then proceeded with Mplus software to construct the 2-Parameter Logic (2-PL) IRT model of the data, a method which allows for estimates of both item discrimination and item difficulty. The utility of this information both for clinical purposes and for scale construction purposes is discussed.},

Participants were 3,295 middle-aged US women (African-American, Caucasian, Chinese, Hispanic, and Japanese) from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) baseline examination (1996-1997). Multiple-indicator, multiple-cause models were used to examine differential item functioning (DIF) on the Everyday Discrimination Scale by race/ethnicity. After adjustment for age, education, and language of interview, meaningful DIF was observed for 3 (out of 10) items: "receiving poorer service in restaurants or stores," "being treated as if you are dishonest," and "being treated with less courtesy than other people" (all P's < 0.001). Consequently, the "profile" of everyday discrimination differed slightly for women of different racial/ethnic groups, with certain "public" experiences appearing to have more salience for African-American and Chinese women and "dishonesty" having more salience for racial/ethnic minority women overall. "Courtesy" appeared to have more salience for Hispanic women only in comparison with African-American women. Findings suggest that the Everyday Discrimination Scale could potentially be used across racial/ethnic groups as originally intended. However, researchers should use caution with items that demonstrated DIF.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of incidence and prevalence of the disease is a vital step toward appropriate interventions for chronic disease like diabetes. A growing body of scientific literature is now available on producing accurate information from administrative data. Advantages of use of administrative data to determine disease incidence include feasibility, accessibility and low cost, but straightforward use of administrative data can produce biased information on incident cases of chronic disease like diabetes. The present study aimed to compare criteria for the selection of diabetes incident cases in a medical administrative database. METHODS: An exhaustive retrospective cohort of diabetes cases was constructed for 2002 using the Canadian National Diabetes Surveillance System case definition (one hospitalization or two physician claims with a diagnosis of diabetes over a 2-year period) with the Quebec health service database. To identify previous occurrence of diabetes in the database, a five-year observation period was evaluated using retrograde survival function and kappa agreement. The use of NDSS case definition to identify incident cases was compared to a single occurrence of an ICD-9 code 250 in the records using the McNemar test. RESULTS: Retrograde survival function showed that the probability of being a true incident case after a 5-year diabetes-free observation period was almost constant and near 0.14. Agreement between 10 years (maximum period) and 5 years and more diabetes-free observation periods were excellent (kappa > 0.9). Respectively 41,261 and 37,473 incident cases were identified using a 5-year diabetes-free observation period with NDSS definition and using a single ICD-9 code 250. CONCLUSION: A 5-year diabetes-free observation period was a conservative time to identify incident cases in an administrative database using one ICD-9 code 250 record.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE There has been increasing interest in the psychiatric literature on research and service delivery focused on first-episode psychosis (FEP), and accurate information on the incidence of FEP is crucial for the development of services targeting patients in the early stages of illness. We sought to obtain a population-based estimate of the incidence of first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis (SSP) among adolescents and young adults in Montreal. METHODS Population-based administrative data from physician billings, hospitalizations, pharmacies, and public health clinics were used to estimate the incidence of first-episode SSP in Montreal. A 3-year period (2004-2006) was used to identify patients with SSP aged 14 to 25 years. We used a 4- to 6-year clearance period to remove patients with a history of any psychotic disorder or prescription for an antipsychotic. RESULTS We identified 456 patients with SSP, yielding a standardized annual incidence of 82.9 per 100 000 for males (95% CI 73.7 to 92.1), and 32.2 per 100 000 for females (95% CI 26.7 to 37.8). Using ecologic indicators of material and social deprivation, we found a higher-incidence proportion of SSP among people living in the most deprived areas, relative to people living in the least deprived areas. CONCLUSIONS Clinical samples obtained from psychiatric services are unlikely to capture all treatment-seeking patients, and epidemiologic surveys have resource-intensive constraints, making this approach challenging for rare forms of psychopathology; therefore, population-based administrative data may be a useful tool for studying the frequency of psychotic disorders.},

   abstract = {Background Overactive bladder (OAB) involves a complex set of symptoms with a lifetime prevalence of any symptom in ~30% of women and 20% of men. Anticholinergic agents are associated with poor medication persistence in OAB treatment. Objective This study evaluated the long-term patterns of use and treatment failure in patients prescribed anticholinergic agents for OAB. Methods This was a nonexperimental, retrospective cohort study. Medical, pharmacy, and eligibility data from the IMS LifeLink Health Plans Claims Database were used. Men and women aged ≥18 years were eligible for inclusion with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis of OAB in any field during the patient study period from January 2005 to June 2010. First documentation of a prescription filled between July 2005 and June 2008 for an anticholinergic agent was defined as the index prescription. Other inclusion criteria were: ≥1 pharmacy claim for an anticholinergic drug between July 2005 and June 2008; continuous enrollment 6 months before the index date, during which no anticholinergic drugs were filled; and 24 months of follow-up from the index prescription. Study outcomes were treatment failure, discontinuation, switch, reinitiation, and adherence. Treatment failure was defined as having a treatment discontinuation (ie, treatment gap of ≥45 days) or switching anticholinergic therapy. Results The analytic cohort comprised 103,250 patients with a mean age of 58.7 years. A majority were female (73%) and privately insured (75%). The vast majority of patients (91.7%) failed to meet their treatment goals with their index anticholinergic agent over the 24-month follow-up period. Of these, 5.8% switched, 51.3% permanently discontinued all anticholinergic agents, and 34.6% reinitiated treatment sometime after 45 days. The mean (SD) time to treatment failure was 159 (216.0) days, with a mean of 1.3 (0.5) unique anticholinergic agents per patient. Forty-eight percent of patients demonstrated appropriate adherence as determined by a medication possession ratio ≥80%. Conclusions This study provides real-world data on treatment patterns over 2 years in a large cohort of patients diagnosed with OAB. Despite the potential for better adherence with some anticholinergic agents, these analyses suggest that such benefits have not yet been realized, and many patients end up without effective pharmacotherapy. Thus, there is a need for new therapies and strategies to increase persistence and adherence to improve outcomes in OAB. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Background: Large, population-based administrative healthcare databases can be used to identify patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) when serum creatinine laboratory results are unavailable. We examined the validity of algorithms that used combined hospital encounter and physician claims database codes for the detection of CKD in Ontario, Canada. Methods. We accrued 123,499 patients over the age of 65 from 2007 to 2010. All patients had a baseline serum creatinine value to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We developed an algorithm of physician claims and hospital encounter codes to search administrative databases for the presence of CKD. We determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of this algorithm to detect our primary threshold of CKD, an eGFR <45 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (15.4% of patients). We also assessed serum creatinine and eGFR values in patients with and without CKD codes (algorithm positive and negative, respectively). Results: Our algorithm required evidence of at least one of eleven CKD codes and 7.7% of patients were algorithm positive. The sensitivity was 32.7% [95% confidence interval: (95% CI): 32.0 to 33.3%]. Sensitivity was lower in women compared to men (25.7 vs. 43.7%; p <0.001) and in the oldest age category (over 80 vs. 66 to 80; 28.4 vs. 37.6 %; p < 0.001). All specificities were over 94%. The positive and negative predictive values were 65.4% (95% CI: 64.4 to 66.3%) and 88.8% (95% CI: 88.6 to 89.0%), respectively. In algorithm positive patients, the median [interquartile range (IQR)] baseline serum creatinine value was 135 mumol/L (106 to 179 mumol/L) compared to 82 mumol/L (69 to 98 mumol/L) for algorithm negative patients. Corresponding eGFR values were 38 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (26 to 51 mL/min per 1.73 m2) vs. 69 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (56 to 82 mL/min per 1.73 m2), respectively. Conclusions: Patients with CKD as identified by our database algorithm had distinctly higher baseline serum creatinine values and lower eGFR values than those without such codes. However, because of limited sensitivity, the prevalence of CKD was underestimated. © 2013 Fleet et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE— Accurate information about the magnitude and distribution of diabetes can inform policy and support health care evaluation.Welinked physician service claims (PSCs) and hospital discharge abstracts (HDAs) to determine diabetes prevalence and incidence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS— A retrospective cohort was constructed us- ing administrative data from the national HDA database, PSCs for Ontario (population 11 million), and registries carrying demographics and vital statistics. All HDAs and PSCs bearing a diagnosis of diabetes (ICD9-CM 250) were selected for 1991–1999. Two previously reported algorithms for identification of diabetes were applied as follows: “1-claim” (any HDA or PSC showing diabetes) and “2-claim” (one HDA or two PSCs within 2 years showing diabetes). Incident cases were defined as individuals who met the criteria for diabetes for the first time after at least 2 years of observation. For validation, diagnostic data abstracted from primary care charts (n ? 3,317) of 57 randomly selected physicians were linked to the administrative data cohort, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS— In 1998, 696,938 individuals met the 1-claim criteria and 528,280 met the 2-claim criteria. Sensitivity for diabetes was 90 and 86%; for the 1- and 2-claim algorithms, specificity was 92 and 97%, respectively, and positive predictive values were 61 and 80%, respectively. Using the 2-claim algorithm, the all-age prevalence increased from 3.2% in 1993 to 4.5% in 1998 (6.1% in adults). Incidence remained stable. CONCLUSIONS— Administrative data can be used to establish population-based inci- dence and prevalence of diabetes. Diabetes prevalence is increasing in Ontario and is consider- ably higher than self-reported rates. Diabetes},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To validate a case definition of pediatric diabetes using administrative health data and describe trends in incidence and prevalence over time in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We sampled hospital records of 700 children from 1994 to 2003 with a prior history of at least one outpatient or hospital record for diabetes mellitus and 300 randomly selected children with no diabetes records. We defined patients as having diabetes based on diagnoses and drug utilization from chart abstraction and compared sensitivity and specificity of a number of combinations of overall health care use using administrative data to develop a highly specific definition. We used Poisson regression to test changes in incidence over time (1994-2003). RESULTS: Use of four physician claims and no hospital records over a 2-yr period yielded the most specific definition (83% sensitivity, 99% specificity). Using this definition overall age/sex standardized incidence per 100,000 was 32.3 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 30.4, 34.4] and prevalence 241.5 per 100 000 (95% CI 236.2-249.9) in 2003/2004. Overall incidence differs by age, (peaking in 10-14 yr olds) but not significantly by sex. The overall incidence has increased on average by 3.1% per year since 1994 (95% CI 1.02-1.04), with no difference in the rate of increase by age. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based surveillance of diabetes in children is possible using administrative data. This will facilitate further study of trends in incidence but also in use of health services and outcomes. Further work to differentiate type 1 and 2 diabetes will be important.},

   abstract = {Objective: Several studies suggest an increasing prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Canada. We aimed to validate a case definition for MS using administrative health insurance data, and to describe the incidence and prevalence of MS in Manitoba, Canada. Methods: We used provincial administrative claims data to identify persons with demyelinating disease using International Classification of Diseases 9/10 codes and prescription claims. To validate the case definition, questionnaires were mailed to 2,000 randomly selected persons with an encounter for demyelinating disease, requesting permission for medical records review. We used diagnoses abstracted from medical records as the gold standard to evaluate candidate case definitions using administrative data. Results: From 1984 to 1997, cases of MS using claims data were defined as persons with >7 medical contacts for MS. From 1998 onward, cases were defined as persons with >3 medical contacts. As compared to medical records, this definition had a positive predictive value of 80.5% and negative predictive value of 75.5%. From 1998 to 2006, the average age-and sex-adjusted annual incidence of MS per 100,000 population was 11.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.7-12.0). The age-adjusted prevalence of MS per 100,000 population increased from 32.6 (95% CI 29.4-35.8) in 1984 to 226.7 (95% CI 218.1-235.3) in 2006, with the peak prevalence shifting to older age groups. Conclusion: The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Manitoba is among the highest in the world. The rising prevalence with minimally changing incidence suggests improving survival. This study supports the use of administrative data to develop case definitions and further define the epidemiology of MS.  2010 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Using a population health services perspective, this article defines and assesses an efficient criteria-based algorithm to identify treatment prevalent and incident cases of schizophrenia. We refer here "treatment" prevalence and incidence since its evaluation depends on a patient receiving a health care service with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was conducted among all adults having a hospital discharge or a physician claim for schizophrenia in the public health plan databases between January 1996 and December 2006. Four algorithms to characterize patients with schizophrenia were defined. To identify treatment incident cases in 2006, we removed from the treatment prevalent pool patients with a previous record of schizophrenia between 1996 and 2006 (10-year clearance period). Using this 10-year period as reference, Kappa coefficients (KC) and positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated to determine the "optimal" length of clearance period to identify incident cases. RESULTS: The lifetime treatment prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia varied from 0.59 to 1.46% and from 42 to 94 per 100,000, respectively. When compared to the 10-year clearance period, the KC is excellent in a clearance period of 6-7 years. To achieve a PPV of 90%, a clearance period of 7-8 years would be necessary. CONCLUSIONS: With an appropriate algorithm, treatment prevalence and incidence of schizophrenia can be conveniently estimated using administrative data. These estimates are a vital step toward appropriate planning of services for schizophrenia.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to estimate the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures faced by households in Kinshasa with children affected by severe malaria. A total of 1350 children below the age of 15 year who were hospitalized due to severe malaria were included in the study. We analyzed the incidence of households facing catastrophic expenditures according to two thresholds: 40% of the household's capacity to pay and 10% of the household's total consumption. Based on the '40% of the capacity to pay' threshold, the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures reached 81.1%, and this estimate reached 46.4% for the '10% above total consumption' threshold. Regarding the ≥40% capacity to pay threshold, the incidences of catastrophic expenditures was higher among households with children who were admitted to state hospitals (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.7) and private hospitals (aOR 59.1), for poor households (aOR 13), for households with medium socioeconomic statuses (aOR 3.2), for female-headed households (aOR 2.9), for households with children affected by the neurological form (aOR 4.8) and respiratory distress (aOR 3.6), and for households who opted for a pre-hospital resort (aOR 2.7). Similar results were obtained when the 10% above the total consumption threshold was applied. Greater government financing of medical attention would lead to a reduction in the catastrophic health expenditures faced by the poorest households.},

   abstract = {Financial risk protection (FRP) is a key objective of national health systems and a core pillar of universal health coverage (UHC). Yet, little is known about the disease-specific distribution of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) at the national level. Using the World Health Surveys (WHS) from 39 countries, we quantified CHE, or household health spending that surpasses 40% of capacity-to-pay by key disease areas. We restricted our analysis to households in which the respondent used health care in the last 30 days and categorized CHE into disease areas included as WHS response options: maternal and child health (MCH); high fever, severe diarrhea, or cough; heart disease; asthma; injury; surgery; and other. We compared disease-specific CHE estimates by income, pooled funding as a share of total health expenditure, share of the population affected by the different diseases, and poverty status. Across countries, an average of 45.1% of CHE cases could not be tied to a specific cause; 37.6% (95% UI 35.4–39.9%) of CHE cases were associated with high fever, severe cough, or diarrhea; 3.9% (3.0–4.9%) with MCH; and 4.1% (3.3–4.9%) with heart disease. Injuries constituted 5.2% (4.2–6.4%) of CHE cases. The distribution of CHE varied substantially by national income. A 10% increase in heart disease prevalence was associated with a 1.9% (1.3–2.4%) increase in heart disease CHE, an association stronger than any other disease area. Our approach is comparable, comprehensive, and empirically based and highlights how financial risk protection may not be aligned with disease burden. Disease-specific CHE estimates can illuminate how health systems can target reform to best protect households from financial risk.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To investigate whether intergroup contact in addition to education is more effective than education alone in reducing stigma of mental illness in adolescents. Design: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial compared education alone with education plus contact. Blocking was used to randomly stratify classes within schools to condition. Random allocation was concealed, generated by a computer algorithm, and undertaken after pretest. Data was collected at pretest and 2-week follow-up. Analyses use an intention-to-treat basis. Setting: Secondary schools in Birmingham, UK. Participants: The parents and guardians of all students in year 8 (age 12-13 years) were approached to take part. Interventions: A 1-day educational programme in each school led by mental health professional staff. Students in the 'contact' condition received an interactive session with a young person with lived experience of mental illness. Outcomes: The primary outcome was students' attitudinal stigma of mental illness. Secondary outcomes included knowledge-based stigma, mental health literacy, emotional well-being and resilience, and help-seeking attitudes.},

   abstract = {The Maximum-likelihood estimator dominates the estimation of general structural equation models. Noniterative, equation-by-equation estimators for factor analysis have received some attention, but little has been done on such estimators for latent variable equations. I propose an alternative 2SLS estimator of the parameters in LISREL type models and contrast it with the existing ones. The new 2SLS estimator allows observed and latent variables to originate from nonnormal distributions, is consistent, has a known asymptotic covafiance matrix, and is es-timable with standard statistical software. Diagnostics for evaluating instrumental variables are described. An empirical example illustrates the estimator. Full-information estimators such as maximum likelihood (ML), generalized least square (GLS), and weighted least squares (WLS) dominate the applications of structural equation modeling (SEM). Despite this, researchers continue to show interest in limited-information, noniterative estimators. Several reasons support this interest. First, in general the ML, GLS, and WLS estimators are more computationally-intensive procedures than are the noniterative estimators. Second, SEM software packages like LISREL (Jrreskog & Sfrbom, 1993) use limited-information, noniterative estima-tors to provide starting values that can reduce the number of iterations and that can lessen the chances of nonconvergence for the iterative estimators. Aside from these computational aspects, consistent noniterative estimators have value in their own right. ML, GLS, and WLS incorporate information from throughout the system in developing estimates. This can improve estimator efficiency. A drawback is that specification error in one part of the system can spread bias to other parts of the model. Limited-information estimators tend to isolate the bias to fewer parts of the system. Nearly all the work on noniterative estimators in the SEM tradition has concentrated on the measurement model or factor analysis (Higglund, 1982; Jrreskog, 1983; Madansky, 1964). An exception is JOreskog and S0rbom (1993) who use a two-stage least squares (2SLS)/instrumental variable (IV) procedure to estimate the coefficients of the latent variable ("structural") model as well. Their estimates require that the measurement model be estimated first and they do not give the distributional properties, standard errors, or significance tests for the coefficients of the latent variable model. This paper has several purposes. First, I propose an alternative 2SLS estimator of I gratefully acknowledge support for this research from the Sociology Program of the National Science Foundation (SES-9121564) and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, Cali-fornia.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND There is increasing interest in using prediction models to identify patients at risk of readmission or death after hospital discharge, but existing models have significant limitations. Electronic medical record (EMR) based models that can be used to predict risk on multiple disease conditions among a wide range of patient demographics early in the hospitalization are needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the degree to which EMR-based risk models for 30-day readmission or mortality accurately identify high risk patients and to compare these models with published claims-based models. METHODS Data were analyzed from all consecutive adult patients admitted to internal medicine services at 7 large hospitals belonging to 3 health systems in Dallas/Fort Worth between November 2009 and October 2010 and split randomly into derivation and validation cohorts. Performance of the model was evaluated against the Canadian LACE mortality or readmission model and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Wide Readmission model. RESULTS Among the 39,604 adults hospitalized for a broad range of medical reasons, 2.8% of patients died, 12.7% were readmitted, and 14.7% were readmitted or died within 30 days after discharge. The electronic multicondition models for the composite outcome of 30-day mortality or readmission had good discrimination using data available within 24 h of admission (C statistic 0.69; 95% CI, 0.68-0.70), or at discharge (0.71; 95% CI, 0.70-0.72), and were significantly better than the LACE model (0.65; 95% CI, 0.64-0.66; P =0.02) with significant NRI (0.16) and IDI (0.039, 95% CI, 0.035-0.044). The electronic multicondition model for 30-day readmission alone had good discrimination using data available within 24 h of admission (C statistic 0.66; 95% CI, 0.65-0.67) or at discharge (0.68; 95% CI, 0.67-0.69), and performed significantly better than the CMS model (0.61; 95% CI, 0.59-0.62; P < 0.01) with significant NRI (0.20) and IDI (0.037, 95% CI, 0.033-0.041). CONCLUSIONS A new electronic multicondition model based on information derived from the EMR predicted mortality and readmission at 30 days, and was superior to previously published claims-based models.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding system presents challenges for using administrative data. Recognizing this, we conducted a multistep process to develop ICD-10 coding algorithms to define Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities in administrative data and assess the performance of the resulting algorithms. Methods: ICD-10 coding algorithms were developed by "translation" of the ICD-9-CM codes constituting Deyo's (for Charlson comorbidities) and Elixhauser's coding algorithms and by physicians' assessment of the face-validity of selected ICD-10 codes. The process of carefully developing ICD-10 algorithms also produced modified and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities. We then used data on in-patients aged 18 years and older in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 administrative hospital discharge data from a Canadian health region to assess the comorbidity frequencies and mortality prediction achieved by the original ICD-9-CM algorithms, the enhanced ICD-9-CM algorithms, and the new ICD-10 coding algorithms. Results: Among 56,585 patients in the ICD-9-CM data and 58,805 patients in the ICD-10 data, frequencies of the 17 Charlson comorbidities and the 30 Elixhauser comorbidities remained generally similar across algorithms. The new ICD-10 and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms either matched or outperformed the original Deyo and Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithms in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistic was 0.842 for Deyo's ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.860 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm, and 0.859 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.868 for the original Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.870 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm and 0.878 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm. Conclusions: These newly developed ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM co-morbidity coding algorithms produce similar estimates of comorbidity prevalence in administrative data, and may outperform existing ICD-9-CM coding algorithms.

This study examined the validity and reliability of Chinese versions of the 26-item EPIC and of the 16-item EPIC for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) in Chinese patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods A Chinese version of the 26-item EPIC and the 16-item EPIC-CP were self-completed by 252 Chinese patients with prostate cancer who were recruited from three community-based cancer service centers. Confirmatory factors analysis assessed the factor structures of the EPIC and the EPIC-CP. Internal consistency and construct and clinical validities of the factor structures were assessed. Results Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the original factor structure of both EPIC-26 and EPIC-CP showed good fit to this sample. A correlated model was superior to a hierarchical model in both EPIC-26 and EPIC-CP supporting the utility of the domain scores over the total scores. Cronbach α ranged from 0.55 to 0.91 for EPIC-26 and 0.44 to 0.67 for EPIC-CP. Construct validity was supported by correlations between EPIC-26/EPIC-CP and psychological distress measures. Clinical validity was supported by differentiation between patients with and without prostatectomy. Conclusions These Chinese versions of the five-factor EPIC-26 and the EPIC-CP are valid and practical measures for assessing a range of health-related quality-of-life issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, highlighting their utility in assessing health-related quality of life for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.},

Objective: The objective of the current study was to develop an Urdu version of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS-U) and validate it for Pakistani patients suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Material and Methods: IPSS-U was developed by a two-step forward and back translation and to evaluate its psychometric properties, a prospective study involving patients suffering from LUTS (n=267) was conducted at Outpatient Urology Department, Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Internal consistency and reproducibility were assessed using Cronbach's alpha and the Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Moreover, exploratory, and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to determine dimensionality of IPSS-U items. Results: Overall reliability of IPSS-U was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha=0.72, ICC of symptom ques-tions=0.92 and ICC of QOL index=0.75). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that two factors were consistent, which together explained 59.8% of the variance. IPSS-U items 1, 3, 5 and 6 were components of the first factor whereas item 2, 4 and 7 were components of the second factor. All the items loaded high on their factors and there were no cross loadings. Moreover, confirmatory factor analysis also showed two-factor model, with acceptable fitting patterns. Conclusion: IPSS-U is a valid and reliable non-gender specific instrument to assess the frequency and severity of LUTS in Urdu-speaking population.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE
We evaluated agreement between patient reported urinary function and bother, and sexual function and bother in patients treated with radical prostatectomy to help inform possible nonfunctional, modifiable mechanisms for patient bother. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients were recruited from 2011 to 2014 at Washington University, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Urinary and sexual outcomes were assessed by EPIC-50 (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-50) before, 5 weeks and 12 months after radical prostatectomy. Spearman rank correlation coefficients and agreement/disagreement categories were used to describe the relation between function and bother. 

RESULTS
Despite moderate to good agreement between function and bother (urinary r = 0.51–0.69 and sexual r = 0.65–0.80) discordant groups were observed. In the urinary domain these groups were men disproportionately bothered by function at baseline (16.9%) and 12 months after radical prostatectomy (6.1%) and men less bothered by function 5 weeks (26.8%) and 12 months (9.9%) after radical prostatectomy. Discordant groups in the sexual domain were men less bothered by function at baseline (20.8%), and 5 weeks (21.1%) and 12 months (15.7%) after radical prostatectomy. Splitting the urinary bother scale into 2 subscales, including one for incontinence related bother to complement the urinary function scale which measures only incontinence, and one for voiding dysfunction related bother yielded considerably better agreement (urinary function and incontinence related bother r = 0.78–0.83). Factors contributing to the group less bothered by sexual function were unclear. 

CONCLUSIONS
When using EPIC-50, investigators should consider splitting the urinary bother scale by the relation to incontinence to prevent distortions of function-bother and comparisons before vs after radical prostatectomy by coexisting voiding dysfunction.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE
We expanded the clinical usefulness of EPIC-CP (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice) by evaluating its responsiveness to health related quality of life changes, defining the minimally important differences for an individual patient change in each domain and applying it to a sexual outcome prediction model. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In 1,201 subjects from a previously described multicenter longitudinal cohort we modeled the EPIC-CP domain scores of each treatment group before treatment, and at short-term and long-term followup. We considered a posttreatment domain score change from pretreatment of 0.5 SD or greater clinically significant and p ≤0.01 statistically significant. We determined the domain minimally important differences using the pooled 0.5 SD of the 2, 6, 12 and 24-month posttreatment changes from pretreatment values. We then recalibrated an EPIC-CP based nomogram model predicting 2-year post-prostatectomy functional erection from that developed using EPIC-26. 

RESULTS
For each health related quality of life domain EPIC-CP was sensitive to similar posttreatment health related quality of life changes with time, as was observed using EPIC-26. The EPIC-CP minimally important differences in changes in the urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual and vitality/hormonal domains were 1.0, 1.3, 1.2, 1.6 and 1.0, respectively. The EPIC-CP based sexual prediction model performed well (AUC 0.76). It showed robust agreement with its EPIC-26 based counterpart with 10% or less predicted probability differences between models in 95% of individuals and a mean ± SD difference of 0.0 ± 0.05 across all individuals. 

CONCLUSIONS
EPIC-CP is responsive to health related quality of life changes during convalescence and it can be used to predict 2-year post-prostatectomy sexual outcomes. It can facilitate shared medical decision making and patient centered care.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES
Widespread implementation of health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) measurement in prostate cancer practice and research requires concise instruments. With 50 questions, the full-length Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is cumbersome to administer outside of studies focusing exclusively on HRQOL. To facilitate HRQOL measurement in a broad range of prostate cancer research and practice settings, we developed and validated an abbreviated version of the EPIC. 

METHODS
The 50 questions that constitute the full-length EPIC-50 were evaluated to identify the items suitable for elimination while retaining the ability to measure the 5 prostate cancer-specific HRQOL domains of the EPIC-50. The resulting abbreviated version (EPIC-26) was validated using question responses from 252 subjects who had undergone brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, or prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The EPIC-26 internal consistency was measured by Cronbach's α coefficient and reliability using test–retest correlation. 

RESULTS
Using the high item–scale correlations, clinically relevant content, and preservation of domain psychometrics, 26 items were retained in the EPIC-26 from the 50 questions in the full-length EPIC-50. A high correlation was observed between the EPIC-50 and EPIC-26 versions for the urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality/hormonal domain scores (all r ≥0.96). The correlations between the different domains were low, confirming that EPIC-26 retained the ability to discern the 5 distinct HRQOL domains. The internal consistency and test–retest reliability for EPIC-26 (Cronbach's α ≥0.70 and r ≥0.69, respectively for all 5 HRQOL domains) supported its validity. 

CONCLUSIONS
EPIC-26 is a brief, valid, and reliable subjective measure of health quality among patients with prostate cancer and is suitable for measuring the HRQOL among patients undergoing treatment of early-stage prostate cancer.},

   abstract = {Partial least squares (PLS) statistical approaches were developed by Hermann Wold over three decades ago. More recently they have become popular in IS research for their ability to sort out perceived and hidden information systems artifacts – artifacts which are often latent constructs – in large, complex, multivariate datasets. Wold (1980, 1981) specifically advised that PLS was not suitable for confirmatory testing, rather should be used for prediction and the exploration of ‘plausible causality,’ though he did not further pursue his definition of ‘plausibility.’ Despite this, PLS is regularly employed for confirmatory testing in IS research, largely because it will converge to parameter estimates when maximum likelihood estimators cannot be found. This note provides a methodological commentary concerning the manner in which confirmatory PLS can be justified, providing that added information about the degree of plausibility is reported. PLS then provides a ‘middle way’ between confirmatory maximum likelihood methods such as LISREL-ML and the less restrictive exploratory model specification searches provided by factor analysis. The note extends existing methods by showing how to compute two plausibility indices to accompany research invoking confirmatory PLS. These will both locate specific research results in the continuum between purely confirmatory and purely exploratory testing, and help to specify required sample sizes for structural model fitting.},

   abstract = {Objective: To better delineate which factors influence the decision to undergo active surveillance of small renal masses. Methods: We identified 204 consecutive patients at our institution with clinical Stage T1 renal masses from June 2009 through June 2010. A variety of demographic and clinical characteristics were measured. Based on our previous work, the "ideal" criteria for active surveillance included tumor size ≤4 cm, Charlson comorbidity index of <2, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of <2, and estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min. We performed sensitivity analyses to identify the characteristics associated with choice of active surveillance and compared these with our "ideal" criteria. Results: Of the 204 patients, 73 (36%) and 131 (64%) underwent active surveillance and treatment, respectively. The patients undergoing active surveillance versus treatment differed with respect to distance from hospital >60 miles (P =.04), ECOG PS of <2 (P <.01), tumor size (P <.01), multifocality (P =.03), endophytic nature of lesion (P =.04), and whether the patient's surgeon generally used a robotic, laparoscopic, or open approach (P =.01). Neither the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (P =.91) nor the Charlson comorbidity index (P =.69) were significant factors. The combination of tumor size <3 cm, ECOG PS of <2, and an endophytic lesion were most predictive of active surveillance. Conclusion: Patient, tumor, and surgeon characteristics all influence the choice of active surveillance. From the sensitivity analyses, active surveillance was driven by a tumor size <3 cm, poor PS (ie, ECOG PS of <2), and an endophytic lesion. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND Previously, the patient-reported Total Illness Burden Index for Prostate Cancer (TIBI-CaP) questionnaire and/or the physician-reported Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) have provided assessments of competing comorbidity during treatment decisions for patients with prostate cancer. In the current study, the authors used these assessments to determine comorbidity and prognosis before prostate biopsy and the subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer to identify those patients least likely to benefit from treatment. METHODS A prospective observational cohort study was performed of 104 participants aged 64.0 years ± 6.5 years from 3 institutions representing different health care delivery systems. Patients were identified before undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and followed for a median of 28 months. Associations between the comorbidity scores and nonelective hospital admissions were investigated using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Among the 104 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, 2 died during the follow-up period. The overall hospital admission rate was 20% (21 of 104 patients). Higher scores on both the TIBI-CaP (≥ 9) and CCI (≥ 3) were found to be significantly associated with an increased odds for hospital admission (odds ratio, 11.3 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.4-53.6] and OR, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.4-22.4]) and hazards ratios (HRs) for time to hospital admission (HR, 3.8 [95% CI, 1.3-11.2] and HR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.1-9.1]), respectively. CONCLUSIONS TIBI-CaP and CCI scores were found to successfully predict which patients were at high risk for nonelective hospital admission. These patients are likely to have poorer health and a potentially shortened lifespan. Therefore, comorbidity analysis using these tools may help to identify those patients who are least likely to benefit from prostate cancer therapy and should avoid prostate biopsy.},

   abstract = {Purpose Prostate cancer (PC) is a devastating and heterogeneous condition with diverse treatment options. When selecting treatments for patients with very high-risk PC, clinicians must consider patient comorbidities. We investigated the efficacy of the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) as a prognostic factor for patient outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP).   Materials and methods We retrospectively investigated the medical records of PC patients at our institution who underwent RP from 1992 to 2010. Very high-risk PC was defined according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Patients with incomplete medical records or who had received neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Preoperative comorbidity was evaluated by the ACCI, and the prognostic efficacy of the ACCI was analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression, competing risk regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves.   Results Our final analysis included 228 men with a median age of 66 years (interquartile range 62–71) and median prostate specific antigen of 10.7 ng/mL. There were 41 (18%) patients with an ACCI score >3 and 88 (38.6%) patients with a biopsy Gleason score >8. Preoperative evaluation revealed that 159 patients (69.7%) had a non-organ confined tumor (≥T3). Following RP, 8-year prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 91.6% and 83.4%, respectively. Competing risk regression analysis revealed that ACCI was significantly associated with other-cause survival and OS (p<0.05).   Conclusion The ACCI is an effective prognostic factor for other-cause survival and OS in very high-risk PC patients. RP should be considered carefully for patients with an ACCI score >3.},

   abstract = {Background: The Charlson index is a widely used measure of comorbidity. The objective was to compare Charlson index scores calculated using administrative data to those calculated using case-note review (CNR) in relation to all-cause mortality and initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the Grampian Laboratory Outcomes Mortality and Morbidity Study (GLOMMS-1) chronic kidney disease cohort. Methods: Modified Charlson index scores were calculated using both data sources in the GLOMMS-1 cohort. Agreement between scores was assessed using the weighted Kappa. The association with outcomes was assessed using Poisson regression, and the performance of each was compared using net reclassification improvement. Results: Of 3382 individuals, median age 78.5 years, 56% female, there was moderate agreement between scores derived from the two data sources (weighted kappa 0.41). Both scores were associated with mortality independent of a number of confounding factors. Administrative data Charlson scores were more strongly associated with death than CNR scores using net reclassification improvement. Neither score was associated with commencing RRT. Conclusion: Despite only moderate agreement, modified Charlson index scores from both data sources were associated with mortality. Neither was associated with commencing RRT. Administrative data compared favourably and may be superior to CNR when used in the Charlson index to predict mortality.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a prospectively applicable method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The I-yr mortality rates for the different scores were : "O", 12% (181); "l-2", 26% (225); "3-4", 52% (71); and " >5", 85% (82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during a IO-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease for the different scores were: "O", 8% (588); "I", 25% (54); "2", 48% (25); " > 3", 59% (18). With each increased level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank x' = 165; p < 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was also a predictor of mortality (p < 0.001). The new index performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein. The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

To explore these ideas, this paper employs a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Novel econometric analysis of asset dynamics over the 1993–98 period identifies a dynamic asset poverty threshold that signals that large numbers of South Africans are indeed trapped without a pathway out of poverty. Qualitative analysis of this period and the period 1998–2001 more deeply examines patterns of mobility, and confirms the continuation of this pattern of limited upward mobility and a low-level poverty trap. In addition, the qualitative data permit a closer look at the specific role played by social relationships. While finding ample evidence of active social capital and networks, these are more helpful for non-poor households. For the poor, social capital at best helps sta...},

   abstract = {Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a quantitative data analysis method that belongs to the family of structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. CFA allows for the assessment of fit between observed data and an a priori conceptualized, theoretically grounded model that specifies the hypothesized causal relations between latent factors and their observed indicator (manifest) variables. Because population-level equivalence between data and model cannot be shown with sample data, CFA should be viewed as a mainly disconfirmatory technique. That is, CFA facilitates the statistical rejection - or, at best, a tentative retention - of a specific theory regarding the factor(s) responsible for the observed relations in the data. If, on the other hand, the investigator's intentions are a mostly ungrounded exploration of relations suggested by the data, classical exploratory factor analysis is the more appropriate approach. In this article, typical steps in a CFA are introduced theoretically and via example: from model specification and identification, to parameter estimation, data-model fit assessment, and potential model modification.

   abstract = {© 2017 The Author(s). Background: Healthcare financing should be equitable. Fairness in financial contribution and protection against financial risk is based on the notion that every household should pay a fair share. Health policy makers have long been concerned with protecting people from the possibility that ill health will lead to catastrophic financial payments and subsequent impoverishment. A number of studies on health care financing equity have been conducted in some provinces of China, but in Guangxi, we found such observation is not enough. What is the situation in Guagnxi? A research on rural areas of Guangxi can add knowledge in this field and help improve the equity and efficiency of health financing, particularly in low-income citizens in rural countries, is a major concern in China's medical sector reform. Methods: Socio-economic characteristics and healthcare payment data were obtained from two rounds of household surveys conducted in 2009 (4634 respondents) and 2013 (3951 respondents). The contributions of funding sources were determined and a progressivity analysis of government healthcare subsidies was performed. Household consumption expenditure and total healthcare payments were calculated and incidence and intensity of catastrophic health payments were measured. Summary indices (concentration index, Kakwani index and Gini coefficient) were obtained for the sources of healthcare financing: indirect taxes, out of pocket payments, and social insurance contributions. Results: The overall health-care financing system was regressive. In 2013, the Kakwani index was 0.0013, the vertical effect of all the three funding sources was 0.0001, and some values exceeded 100%, indicating that vertical inequity had a large influence on causing total health financing inequity. The headcount of catastrophic health payment declined sharply between 2009 and 2013, using total expenditure (from 7.3% to 1.2%) or non-food expenditure (from 26.1% to 7.5%) as the indicator of household capacity to pay. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates an inequitable distribution of government healthcare subsidies in China from 2009 to 2013, and the inequity was reduced, especially in rural areas. Future healthcare reforms in China should not only focus on expanding the coverage, but also on improving the equity of distribution of healthcare benefits.},

   abstract = {• Results of a statistical analysis have to be generalizable to be scientifically useful • A model proposes a general functional relation between the unknown parameter(s) and the observed data. It allows us to make predictions. • The goal of a statistical analysis is to estimate the unknown parameter(s) in the proposed model • The likelihood function is central to the process of estimating the unknown parameters. Older and less sophisticated methods include the method of moments, and the method of minimum chi-square for count data. These estimators are not always efficient, and their sampling distributions are often mathematically intractable. Example: Least squares vs. linear regression: One can fit a best straight line to explain the relation between two continuous variables X and Y using a least squares approach. The intercept (β 0) and slope (β 1) parameters can be estimated as the values that minimize the squared loss: (Y i − β 0 − β 1 X i) 2. Using this approach, we cannot say anything about the precision of our estimates, or about future values of Y for a given X. In order to do so, we would need to make some assumption about the probability distribution of the error term, i = Y i − β 0 − β 1 X i. Example: Binned data: Likelihood provides a very flexible approach to combining data, provided one has a probability model for them. As a simple example, consider the challenge of estimating the mean µ from several independent observations for a N (µ, σ) process, but where each observation is recorded to a different degree of numerical 'rounding' or 'binning.' For example, imagine that because of the differences with which the data were recorded, the n = 4 observations are y 1 ∈ [4, 6), y 2 ∈ [3, 4), y 3 ∈ [5, ∞), y 4 ∈ [−∞, 3.6). Even if we were told the true value of σ, the least squares method cannot handle this uni-parameter 1},

   abstract = {† Financial interest and/or other relationship with Merck, Medtronic, Lilly and Pfizer. Purpose: No standard case definition exists for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome for patient screening or epidemiological studies. As part of the RAND Interstitial Cystitis Epidemiology study, we developed a case definition for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome with known sensitivity and speci-ficity. We compared this definition with others used in interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome epidemiological studies. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the literature and performed a structured, expert panel process to arrive at an interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome case definition. We developed a questionnaire to assess interstitial cystitis/pain-ful bladder syndrome symptoms using this case definition and others used in the literature. We administered the questionnaire to 599 women with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, overactive bladder, endometriosis or vulvo-dynia. The sensitivity and specificity of each definition was calculated using physician assigned diagnoses as the reference standard. Results: No single epidemiological definition had high sensitivity and high spec-ificity. Thus, 2 definitions were developed. One had high sensitivity (81%) and low specificity (54%), and the other had the converse (48% sensitivity and 83% specificity). These values were comparable or superior to those of other epidemiological definitions used in interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome prevalence studies. Conclusions: No single case definition of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome provides high sensitivity and high specificity to identify the condition. For prevalence studies of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome the best approach may be to use 2 definitions that would yield a prevalence range. The RAND Interstitial Cystitis Epidemiology interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome case definitions, developed through structured consensus and validation, can be used for this purpose.},

   abstract = {The Standardisation Subcommittee of the International Continence Society (ICS) now recognizes overactive bladder (OAB) as a "symptom syndrome suggestive of lower urinary tract dysfunction." It is specifically defined as "urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia." The ICS definition was not formulated until January 2001 and was not formally approved until September 2001. Therefore, collection and discussion of the epidemiologic characteristics of OAB are somewhat hampered by the different definitions of this condition used by different investigators. Most communications that appeared before 2000 more often described characteristics of incontinence rather than OAB, and the estimates of OAB prevalence within those studies varied significantly. Until recently, little definite epidemiologic information was available on the prevalence and comorbidities of OAB. An important challenge in treating OAB is to increase awareness of this significant problem worldwide and to impress on other specialists and primary care physicians the importance of identifying this clinical problem and managing it in a way that will maximize quality-of-life improvement while minimizing morbidity.

   abstract = {Background: One of the challenges of health-related quality of life research is to translate statistically significant health-related quality of life changes into interpretable clinical or medically important ones. Objective: To calculate the minimal important difference of the King's Health Questionnaire, a condition-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire for the assessment of men and women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Methods: The King's Health Questionnaire was administered to patients suffering from overactive bladder enrolled in two multinational studies. Minimal important differences were calculated using an anchor-based approach with both a global rating of patient-perceived treatment benefit and one of perceived disease impact. A distribution-based method using effect size was calculated for comparison purposes. Results: Minimal important difference values varied slightly with each method. Using the anchor-based approach, the King's Health Questionnaire minimal important difference ranged between 5-10 points when the calculation factored out patients who reported no change and 6-12 points for patients who experienced a small improvement. The effect size method indicated a minimal important difference of 5 to 6 points for a small effect and 10 to 15 points for a medium effect. Conclusions: In the case of the King's Health Questionnaire, the anchor-based approaches and the distribution-based approach provide similar results. A change from baseline of at least 5 points on King's Health Questionnaire domains indicates a change that is meaningful to patients and is indicative of a clinically meaningful improvement in health-related quality of life after treatment. Convergence of the estimates using different approaches should give us confidence in the values derived for the quality of life domains measured by the King's Health Questionnaire.},

According to the National Overactive Bladder Evaluation (NOBLE) program , the estimation of OAB prevalence in USA was 16.9% in women aged ≥18 years (6). The EPIC study, which used the 2002 ICS definition, demonstrated that the overall prevalence of OAB was 12.9% in women. In recent studies, the prevalence of OAB was 8.9% in Canadian women and 19.6% in Swedish women (4). UI and OAB are highly common problems; factors affecting their prevalence are often sought by clinicians and researchers to improve the management and treatment of these conditions. The estimated prevalence of UI and OAB varies markedly from study to study, because the studies are generally based on self-reports without clinical proof. Also, meth-odological differences have significant impacts on the results of epidemiological studies. Specifically, the prevalence of UUI has been estimated insufficiently due to the differentiation of the definition of OAB and UUI. Furthermore, prevalence rates may depend on age, race, socioeconomic and educational levels of participants. The first aim of this paper was to investigate the prevalence of OAB and UI and subtypes of UI in Turkish women. The second aim was to determine the associated risk factors. Our final aim was to analyze the effect of UI on Quality of life.},

Generally, occurs in elderly people, about 9 out of 10 people are over 55 years old, with the average age at diagnosis of 73 years. Males are more likely than women to have this neoplasm with a probability of 1 in 27 (for women the probability is 1 in 89). Most bladder cancers begin in the inner layer, also called the urothelium or transitional epithelium. As it advances, it invades the layers of the bladder and can invade adjacent structures, often metastasizing to distant lymph nodes, bones, lungs or the liver. Among the cancers that originate in the bladder authors have: Urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma), squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, sarcoma. Hematuria occurs in the majority of patients with urothelial carcinoma. Symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency and pain may also occur, or it may also be asymptomatic.  In this case report, an atypical presentation of bladder cancer is shown, simulating the symptomatology of a Hyperactive Bladder Syndrome.},

We find that the program significantly increased both government- and village-financed investments. While the program did not increase the income or consumption of poorer households, it did increase the income and consumption of richer households by 6.1 to 9.2%. We also find suggestive evidence that governance matters in the distribution of program benefits. Relative gains were greater for richer households in villages with more educated leaders, and higher quality village committees delivered greater benefits to both richer and poorer households. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods: An analysis of a national representative sample of 38,945 rural households (129,635 people) from the 2008 National Health Service Survey was performed. Logistic regression models used binary indicator of catastrophic health expenditure as dependent variable, with household consumption, demographic characteristics, health insurance schemes, and chronic illness as independent variables. Results: Higher percentage of households experiencing catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment correlates to increased health care need. While the higher socio-economic status households had similar levels of catastrophic health expenditure as compared with the lowest. Households covered by the NCMS had similar levels of catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment as those without health insurance. Conclusion: Despite over 95% of coverage, the NCMS has failed to prevent catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment. An upgrade of benefit packages is needed, and effective cost control mechanisms on the provider side needs to be considered. © 2014 Li et al.},

   abstract = {China's medical insurance system has changed dramatically in the past two decades. The country's most established programme, the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance, dates back to the mid-1990s and initially covered only 109 million employees of state-owned and collective enterprises. 1 In the early 2000s, the Chinese Government established two additional insurance programmes, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) for rural residents and the Urban Resident Medical Insurance (URMI) programme for self-employed and unemployed urban residents. These three insurance schemes enabled China to achieve near universal health-care coverage, with more than 1·3 billion Chinese (about 97% of the population) having some form of medical insurance. 2 However, this nationwide coverage was insufficient for service provision and financial protection, and health-care expenses remained a concern for patients. For instance, insurance reimbursement rates were as low as 30–40% for NCMS before 2009. 3 With high out-of-pocket costs, catastrophic illnesses 4 were often financially devastating for patients and led families into poverty. In 2009, China's health reforms focused on reducing out-of-pocket spending. 5 Led by Zhigang Sun who was the former director of the Office of Health Reform in the State Council, catastrophic medical insurance was introduced in 2012, piloted in more than 134 cities from 2013, and implemented nationally in 2016. Within 1 year, more than 4 million patients with a catastrophic illness received financial assistance through this programme. 6 Catastrophic medical insurance, which has no additional fees, provides supplementary coverage for individuals insured through URMI and NCMS and is mainly funded},

   abstract = {The issue of multidimensionality is well established in poverty research, and it is generally recognised that income alone is inadequate as a measure of social inclusion or quality of life (QoL). However, social policy still tends to address the different dimensions of QoL—such as poverty, health, housing and social cohesion—in isolation. This raises the question of the variation across dimensions or groups in the extent of multidimensionality. For instance, are housing or health problems experienced by people with a range of other QoL problems, or do they tend to occur in isolation? Does this differ between social risk groups, such as lone parents, older adults or children? The answers have implications for the service needs of people with health problems or with inadequate housing.

We found that rural Dibao's targeting performance was quite poor based on income poverty standards. When based on multidimensional poverty, Dibao's targeting performance was better than based on income poverty. Dibao's intra-village targeting accounted for more of its targeting performance than inter-village targeting. We also found political elite capture effects to exist for both Dibao participation and transfer value received. Moreover, the political elite capture effect from close relatives was larger in magnitude than that from household members. Having a household member being a village leader in the village of residence had no significant elite capture effect, whereas having members with a political leader position outside the village of residence or being a non-leader political party member was associated with a greater chance of welfare participation. These findings suggest that targeting errors in developing countries’ CBT welfare programs such as China's rural Dibao is still substantial and political elite capture may be one important reason for them.},

Many studies indicate that nurse-to-resident staffing ratios remain very low (Harrington et al. 2016), which may harm a sizable portion of a particularly vulnerable elderly population. As the US population ages, and spending on nursing homes increases, it is important to understand why nursing homes lack incentives to improve the quality of care so that appropriate policy instruments can be designed. In this paper, I develop a structural model of the nursing home industry to simulate the effects of policies that either raise regulated Medicaid reimbursement rates or increase local competition via directed entry on the quality of care.

Using structured additive distributional regression, we find that the association between income and health is larger than generally estimated because aspects of the conditional health distribution that go beyond the expectation imply worse outcomes for those with lower incomes. Looking at German data from the Socio-Economic Panel, we find that the risk of bad health is roughly halved when doubling the net equivalent income from 15,000 to 30,000?. This is more than tenfold of the magnitude of change found when considering expected health measures. A distributional perspective thus highlights another dimension of the income?health relation?that the poor are in particular faced with greater health risk at the lower end of the health distribution. We therefore argue that when studying health outcomes, a distributional approach that considers stochastic variation among observationally equivalent individuals is warranted.},

   abstract = {Amid persistent interest in and concerns about traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM) in low-, middle-and high-income countries, the global community of healthcare is in need of learning ways to institutionalize TCAM with biomedicine. By investigating how traditional East Asian medicine (TEAM), one of the most popular forms of TCAM in the world, is institutional-ized in China, Korea and Japan, this study finds three different ways of instituting a plural medical system in which TCAM and biomedicine intersect with each other. In the interpenetrative pluralism in China and the exclusionary pluralism in Korea, TEAM and biomedicine are institutionalized as independent and equivalent systems of medical practices. However, TEAM and biomedicine are conditioned to cross over into each other unconditionally in practice in the former, whereas the two exclude each other very strictly in the latter. In the subjugatory pluralism in Japan, the crisscrossing of TEAM and biomedicine is allowed, yet in an asymmetrical way whereby the practice of TEAM is dependent upon and subordinated into biomedicine. The practice of various TEAM modalities is overseen by TEAM doctors, biomedicine doctors or integrative TEAM-biomedicine doctors in inter-penetrative pluralism, by TEAM doctors only in exclusionary pluralism, and by biomedicine doctors only in subjugatory pluralism. These varying characteristics demonstrate a variety of plural medical systems. They also provide useful cues in accounting for the varying behaviours of medical service providers and users who encounter TCAM as well as biomedicine in their everyday practices. In addition, the growing literature about the outcomes of TCAM and plural medical systems can take advantage of these findings. • Three institutional principles underlie plural medical systems of TCAM and biomedicine in East Asia: interpenetrative pluralism in China, exclusionary pluralism in Korea, and subjugatory pluralism in Japan. • These institutional characteristics are potentially related to the varying behaviour of medical service providers and users of both TCAM and biomedicine. • Studies of healthcare planning and outcomes need to pay attention to the institutional characteristics of each plural medical system.},

   abstract = {We propose a generic Bayesian framework for inference in distri-butional regression models in which each parameter of a potentially complex response distribution and not only the mean is related to a structured additive predictor. The latter is composed additively of a variety of different functional effect types such as nonlinear effects, spatial effects, random coefficients, interaction surfaces or other (pos-sibly nonstandard) basis function representations. To enforce specific properties of the functional effects such as smoothness, informative multivariate Gaussian priors are assigned to the basis function coefficients. Inference can then be based on computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques where a generic procedure makes use of distribution-specific iteratively weighted least squares approximations to the full conditionals. The framework of distributional regression encompasses many special cases relevant for treating nonstandard response structures such as highly skewed non-negative responses, overdispersed and zero-inflated counts or shares including the possibility for zero-and one-inflation. We discuss distri-butional regression along a study on determinants of labour incomes for full-time working males in Germany with a particular focus on regional differences after the German reunification.

In conjunction with a Community Advisory Committee, this research project explored knowledge and experiences of mental wellness among urban Indigenous Elders in the Southern Interior of British Columbia. This project used a qualitative methodology, including traditional and modified sharing circles and individual interviews for data collection. The resulting transcripts were thematically analyzed. Internal validity was established using member checking. Five themes were identified, including: holistic wellness; poor mental wellness outcomes; determinants of mental wellness; the healing journey; and, services and supports. A self-reflection chapter provides insight on the project from the student's perspective. The research findings are located within the existing academic literature, and the unique ways urban Indigenous Elders experience mental wellness are discussed. Implications of the findings are provided for healthcare systems, cultural safety, policy makers, inter-sectoral collaboration, and future research.},

   abstract = {During the last decade microcredit has exploded in Bangladesh, as well as in a large part of the third world. Empirical studies give strong evidence that microcredit has had positive effects on two vital areas of national development; namely, the alleviation of poverty and the empowerment of women. Despite these positive impacts, some critics question the efficacy of microcredit in reaching the extreme poor. Some argue that while microcredit has contributed positively to the well-being of the poor in general, it has failed to reach the poorest of the poor. This paper explores the reasons why microcredit programs rarely reach the poorest of the poor in rural Bangladesh. The reasons have been divided into five categories: (1) supply, (2) demand, (3) NGDOs' norms and social issues, (4) voluntary and involuntary dropouts, and (5) sustainable financial services. This paper also argues that microcredit alone is not necessarily the best way to help the poorest of the poor.},

This paper does not suggest a single set of "correct" assumptions, because the assumptions adopted in a cost-effectiveness analysis should reflect the perspective of the intended user. Rather, we discuss the issues surrounding many of these assumptions, such as what discount rate to use or whether to include cash transfers as program costs, and make recommendations on which assumptions might be reasonable given the perspective of a policymaker allocating resources between different projects. Examples are drawn from the education field to illustrate key issues and focus on specific applications to education. We hope this paper will contribute to the development of a more standard methodology for cost-effectiveness analyses and a better understanding of how these analyses can be created and used.},

   abstract = {Executive Summary This paper assesses the current state of research knowledge on linkages between poverty and health as of February 2002. While it refers extensively to the existing research literature, its goal is not to provide an exhaustive survey, but rather to summarize, and to provide a starting point from which to learn and think about future directions. Measuring Poverty: Assessing Socio-economic Status This paper begins with the premise that we cannot understand connections between socioeconomic status (SES) and health until we have thought carefully about and devised the very best measures possible for these concepts. Section 1 begins with a discussion of alternative methods for conceptualizing and measuring SES. Consistent with a clear consensus in the literature, it argues that household income after taxes and transfers, appropriately adjusted to account for differences in family size and assigned to each individual within the family, is the best readily available measure of individual SES. Limitations of this measure as a true measure of SES, however, are noted. For example, household income does not take account of time required to earn income and the measure does not pay attention to distribution within families or to wealth. Unfortunately, microdata surveys with a health focus, such as the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth and the National Population Health Survey, do not currently provide particularly good measures of family income, nor do they offer estimates of family wealth. Improvements in the socio-economic information provided in these surveys could improve the quality of the research possible in Canada. The section provides a discussion of how to assess the extent of both inequality and deprivation (i.e. poverty) within a population, and attempts to identify best practice from the literature in each case. For example, most researchers in the field of poverty and inequality argue that for a rich country such as Canada, poverty should be viewed in relative rather than absolute terms. Many researchers also now argue in favour of summarizing the extent of poverty in a country using a measure of poverty intensity that incorporates: 1) incidence; 2) depth of poverty; and 3) a measure of inequality among the poor. Newly available Canadian longitudinal surveys, which follow the same individuals across time, have created the opportunity to study the dynamics of SES. These surveys are likely to be especially important for research on poverty and health, since long-duration poverty or extreme economic insecurity will likely have particularly important links with health.},

   abstract = {A distributed-lag model is a dynamic model in which the effect of a regressor x on y occurs over time rather than all at once. In the simple case of one explanatory variable and a linear relationship, we can write the model as () 0 , t t t s t s t s y L x u x u ∞ − = = α + β + = α + β + ∑ (3.1) where u t is a stationary error term. 1 This form is very similar to the infinite-moving-average representation of an ARMA process, except that the lag polynomial on the right-hand side is applied to the explanatory variable x rather than to a white-noise process ε. The individual coefficients β s are called lag weights and the collectively comprise the lag distribution. They define the pattern of how x affects y over time. We cannot, of course, estimate an infinite number of β coefficients in (3.1). One practical method is to truncate the lag in (3.1) to finite length q, which is appropriate if the lag distribution is effectively zero beyond q periods. Another approach is to use a functional form that allows the lag distribution in (3.1) to decay gradually to zero. We saw above that a stationary autoregressive process can be expressed as an infinite moving average with declining lag weights, so a form with one or more lags of y on the right-hand side will allow infinite-length lag distributions while requiring estimation of only a small number of parameters. One difficulty that is common to all distributed-lag models is choice of lag length, whether this be choosing the point q at which to truncate a finite lag distribution in (3.1) or choosing how many lagged dependent variables to include. We defer this question until later in the chapter, after various distributed-lag models have been introduced. 3.1 Dynamic effects of temporary and permanent changes In cross-sectional models, we often used econometric methods to estimate the marginal effect of an independent variable x on the dependent variable y, holding all of the other independent variables constant: / y x ∂ ∂. In time-series models, we must consider not only how 1 We assume that y t does not depend on future values of x, thus we exclude negative values of s from the summation. However, it is theoretically possible to have "negative lags" on the right-hand side, for example, people might change their behavior now if they know that a law is going to change in the future. Equation (3.1) can be modified appropriately for such circumstances.},

   abstract = {For a time series variable y t , the observations usually are indexed by a t subscript instead of i. Unless stated otherwise, we assume that y t is observed at each period t = 1,. .. , n, and these periods are evenly spaced over time, e.g. years, months, or quarters. y t can be a flow variable (e.g. GDP, trading volume), or a stock variable (e.g. capital stock) or a price or interest rate. For stock variables or prices, it can be important how they are defined, since they may vary within the period. A price at period t might be defined as the price in the middle of the period, at the end of the period, the average price over the period, etc. A model that describes how y t evolves over time is called a time series process, and a regression model that has terms from different time periods entering in the same equation is a dynamic model. An example of a dynamic model is: y t = β 0 + β 1 y t−1 + β 2 x t + β 3 x t−1 + u t Models with time series variables usually are dynamic models, but not necessarily. You might have y t = γ 0 + γ 1 x t + u t where u t is distributed independently of its past values. This is not a dynamic model, because there is nothing in it that links the different time periods.},

From a stratified random cluster sample of 3101 households, 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments were identified and interviewed. A validity test of the screening method was conducted, from which we obtained the adjusted total number of households with catastrophic payments in the sample of 3101. The health payment-induced poverty incidence and severity were compared without and with NCMS reimbursements.Results Before the NCMS intervention, 5.06 of the sample households fell below the national poverty line due to health payments in 2004, compared with 4.03 after reimbursements. With NCMS reimbursements, the health payment-induced poverty gap of those households still remaining below the Chinese national poverty line dropped by 19.2 to an average of 977.2 Yuan.Conclusion Out-of-pocket health payments remain a severe burden for rural households.

S E T T I N G : In 2002-2004 we studied 160 new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases and 320 age-and sex-matched controls living in neighbouring houses in four rural counties of Henan Province. D E S I G N : Cases and controls were interviewed 1-3 months after patients were diagnosed. We used matched multi-variate logistic regression to compare cases with controls for poverty status using household income, household assets and relative wealth within the village. We conducted follow-up interviews of patients 10-12 months later to assess economic effects by collecting data on treatment costs, income losses, coping strategies and treatment completion. R E S U L T S : Poverty is strongly associated with TB incidence even after controlling for smoking and other risk factors. Excluding income losses, direct out-of-pocket treatment costs (medical and non-medical) accounted for 55.5% of average annual household income, and most TB cases fell into heavy debt. The DOTS cure rate was 91%. When DOTS was incomplete or not done, mortality was high. C O N C L U S I O N S : Poverty is both a cause and a devastating outcome of TB. Ongoing poverty reduction schemes in China must also include reducing TB.},

   abstract = {The overall goal of the paper is to understand the progress of the design and implementation of China's New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) program between 2004 (the second year of the program) and 2007. In the paper we seek to assess some of the strengths and weaknesses of the program using a panel of national-representative, household survey data that were collected in 2005 and early 2008. According to our data, we confirm the recent reports by the Ministry of Health that there have been substantial improvements to the NCMS program in terms of coverage and participation. We also show that rural individuals also perceive an improvement in service by 2007. While the progress of the NCMS program is clear, there are still weaknesses. Most importantly, the program clearly does not meet one of its key goals of providing insurance against catastrophic illnesses. On average, individuals that required inpatient treatment in 2007 were reimbursed for 15% of their expenditures. Although this is higher than in 2004, on average, as the severity of the illness (in terms of expenditures on health care) rose, the real reimbursement rate (reimbursement amount/total expenditure on medical care) fell. The real reimbursement rate for illnesses that required expenditures between 4000 and 10,000 yuan (over 10,000 yuan) was only 11% (8%). Our analysis shows that one of the limiting factors is constrained funding.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a critical review of studies carried out in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) focusing on the economic consequences for households of illness and health care use. These include household level impacts of direct costs (medical treatment and related financial costs), indirect costs (productive time losses resulting from illness) and subsequent household responses. It highlights that health care financing strategies that place considerable emphasis on out-of-pocket payments can impoverish households. There is growing evidence of households being pushed into poverty or forced into deeper poverty when faced with substantial medical expenses, particularly when combined with a loss of household income due to ill-health. Health sector reforms in LMICs since the late 1980s have particularly focused on promoting user fees for public sector health services and increasing the role of the private for-profit sector in health care provision. This has increasingly placed the burden of paying for health care on individuals experiencing poor health. This trend seems to continue even though some countries and international organisations are considering a shift away from their previous pro-user fee agenda. Research into alternative health care financing strategies and related mechanisms for coping with the direct and indirect costs of illness is urgently required to inform the development of appropriate social policies to improve access to essential health services and break the vicious cycle between illness and poverty. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

The absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching esti-mators are not N 1/2-consistent in general and describe conditions under which matching estimators do attain N 1/2-consistency. Second, we show that even in settings where matching estimators are N 1/2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not require consistent non-parametric estimation of unknown functions. Software for implementing these methods is available in Matlab, Stata, and R.},

Three survey locations were used: doctors' offices, a public shopping area, and meetings of a women's organization. A total of 636 community residents, varying across major demographic categories, participated. Participants completed a 23-item survey, designed to assess which factors consumers perceive as most relevant in choosing a PCD. Participants perceived professionally relevant factors (e.g. whether the doctor is board certified, office appearance) and management practices (e.g. time to get an appointment, evening and weekend hours) as more important than the doctor's personal characteristics (race, age, gender, etc.). Participants' own characteristics bore little relationship to the perceived importance of doctor characteristics. Factors patients perceive as most important to their choice of a PCD are also those that have the greatest effect on the quality of healthcare they will receive. However, they do not always have access to this information. A better understanding of the factors that influence people's choice of a PCD can contribute to efforts to provide them with the resources to make well-informed decisions in selecting among healthcare options.},

   abstract = {What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The ICS has divided LUTS into three groups: storage, voiding and post-micturition symptoms. The classification is based on anatomical, physiological and urodynamic considerations of a theoretical nature. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the inter-correlations of various LUTS, which is a novel approach to research and can strengthen existing knowledge of the phenomenology of LUTS. After we had completed our analyses, another study was published that used a similar approach and results were very similar to those of the present study. We evaluated the constellation of LUTS using PCA of the data from a population-based study that included >4000 men. In our analysis, three components emerged from the 12 LUTS: voiding, storage and incontinence components. Our results indicated that incontinence may be separate from the other storage symptoms and post-micturition symptoms should perhaps be regarded as voiding symptoms. Objective To determine how lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) relate to each other and assess if the classification proposed by the International Continence Society (ICS) is consistent with empirical findings. Materials And Methods The information on urinary symptoms for this population-based study was collected using a self-administered postal questionnaire in 2004. The questionnaire was sent to 7470 men, aged 30-80 years, from Pirkanmaa County (Finland), of whom 4384 (58.7%) returned the questionnaire. The Danish Prostatic Symptom Score-1 questionnaire was used to evaluate urinary symptoms. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the inter-correlations among various urinary symptoms. Results The PCA produced a grouping of 12 LUTS into three categories consisting of voiding, storage and incontinence symptoms. Post-micturition symptoms were related to voiding symptoms, but incontinence symptoms were separate from storage symptoms. In the analyses by age group, similar categorization was found at ages 40, 50, 60 and 80 years, but only two groups of symptoms emerged among men aged 70 years. The prevalence among men aged 30 was too low for meaningful analysis. Conclusions This population-based study suggests that LUTS can be divided into three subgroups consisting of voiding, storage and incontinence symptoms based on their inter-correlations. Our empirical findings suggest an alternative grouping of LUTS. The potential utility of such an approach requires careful consideration. © 2012 BJU International.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence and describe the profile of catastrophic expenditures and impoverishment due to household out-of-pocket payments, comparing the periods before and after the introduction of universal health care coverage (UC). METHODS: Secondary data analyses of socioeconomic surveys on nationally representative households pre-UC in 2000 (n = 24 747) and post-UC in 2002 (n = 34 785) and 2004 (n = 34 843). FINDINGS: Households using inpatient care experienced catastrophic expenditures most often (31.0% in 2000, compared with 15.1% and 14.6% in 2002 and 2004, respectively). During the two post-UC periods, the incidence of catastrophic expenditures for inpatient services at private hospitals was 32.1% for 2002 and 27.8% for 2004. For those using inpatient care at district hospitals, the corresponding catastrophic expenditures figures were 6.5% and 7.3% in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The catastrophic expenditures incidence for outpatient services from private hospitals moved from 27.9% to 28.5% between 2002 and 2004. In 2000, before universal coverage was introduced, the percentages of Thai households who used private hospitals and faced catastrophic expenditures were 35.8% for inpatient care and 36.0% for outpatient care. Impoverishment increased for poor households because of payments for inpatient services by 84.0% in 2002, by 71.5% in 2004 and by 95.6% in 2000. The relative increase in out-of-pocket impoverishment was found in 98.8% to 100% of those who were poor following payments made to private hospitals, regardless of type of care. CONCLUSION: Households using inpatient services, especially at private hospitals, were more likely to face catastrophic expenditures and impoverishment from out-of-pocket payments. Use of services not covered by the UC benefit package and bypassing the designated providers (prohibited under the capitation contract model without proper referrals) are major causes of catastrophic expenditures and impoverishment.},

   abstract = {Out-of-pocket patient payments can impose a catastrophic burden on households. This problem may not only affect poor but also wealthy households who need to use health care frequently. The available literature offers no consensus on how to measure poverty and how to measure the effects of out-of-pocket payments on household budgets. The objective of this paper is to contribute to current research in this area by comparing results across different approaches. In particular, the paper examines the catastrophic and impoverishing effects of health care spending in Serbia applying different types of thresholds used in previous research. The application of various approaches allows us to analyze the robustness and convergent validity of the results. We also include the subjective poverty approach in our examination. We use household data from the Serbian Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS). The Serbian LSMS data were collected in 2007 and consists of 17,375 participants living in 5557 households (sample representative for Serbia). Our results indicate that irrespective of the approach applied, out-of-pocket patient payments have a catastrophic effect on poor households in Serbia. Moreover, households that are above the absolute, relative and subjective poverty lines respectively, after the subtraction of out-of-pocket payments fall below these poverty lines. The probability of catastrophic out-of-pocket patient payments is higher in rural areas, in larger households, and among chronically sick household members (namely, people with diabetes and mental diseases, as well as cardiology diseases in some instances). Perceived health status also appears to be a significant indicator. Policy in Serbia should aim to protect vulnerable groups, especially chronically sick patients and people from rural areas.},

In this article we assess how Mexico turned evidence on catastrophic and impoverishing health spending into a catalyst for institutional renovation through the reform that created Seguro Popular (Popular Health Insurance). We present 15-year trends on the evolution of catastrophic and impoverishing health spending, including evidence on how the situation is improving.

In respect of the ambulance technician these factors may be described as; core professional skills, individual and collaborative approaches to health and safety, and the management of self and clinical situations. For the paramedic the themes are; core professional skills, management of self and clinical situations, and approaches to health and safety. For the clinical supervisor there is again a theme described as core professional skills, with a further two themes described as role model and lifelong learning. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of desirable attributes emerging from this study are remarkably similar to the generic benchmark statements for health care programmes outlined by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. It seems that a case is emerging for a revision of the curriculum currently used for the education and training of ambulance staff, which is more suited to a consumer led health service and which reflects the broader professional base seen in programmes associated with other healthcare professions. This study has suggested outline content, and module structure for the education of the technician, paramedic, and clinical supervisor, based on empirical evidence.},

For example, it is well-known that with panel data, fixed effects models eliminate time-invariant confounding, estimating an independent variable's effect using only within-unit variation. When researchers interpret the results of fixed effects models, they should therefore consider hypothetical changes in the independent variable (coun-terfactuals) that could plausibly occur within units to avoid overstating the substantive importance of the variable's effect. In this article, we replicate several recent studies which used fixed effects estimators to show how descriptions of the substantive significance of results can be improved by precisely characterizing the variation being studied and presenting plausible counterfactuals. We provide a checklist for the interpretation of fixed effects regression results to help avoid these interpretative pitfalls.},

Estimates of models of poor county designation and poverty fund allocation and newly defined targeting gap and targeting error measures show that political factors have affected targeting and that leakage has increased while coverage has improved. Only one of the three main programs is progressive. Growth model estimates find that poor county designation increased incomes per capita by 2.28% per year during 1985-1992 and 0.91% during 1992-1995.

China was once the developing country with the largest rural poor population in the world. Facing the decreasing effect of economic input to poverty reduction, land policy innovations could contribute to promoting poverty alleviation, particularly in China, where the defects in policy making is regarded as a major factor in rural poverty. This study explores the institutional innovation of China’s poverty alleviation since 2013 and further reveals the mechanism behind land policy innovation promoting the targeted poverty alleviation based on a case study of Songjiagou village of Fuping county, Hebei province. We found that the Chinese central government has innovated the mechanism for the TPA to lift the remaining rural poor out of poverty by 2020 as scheduled. Implementing the TPA could confront the labor, capital and land dilemmas. Combined land policy innovations and land engineering with the ex situ poverty alleviation relocation (ESPAR) can help to break the institutional barriers. We argue that land policy innovations and the ESPAR not only contributes to poverty reduction and improve living conditions of the poor, but also needs to guard against its potential risk. These findings can provide policymakers with a sound scientific basis for poverty reduction planning and decisions in China and other poor countries.},

   abstract = {This paper examines the impacts of health on Economic growth in Nigeria. The Cointegration, and Granger Causality techniques were used in analysing Quarterly time series data of Nigeria for the period of 1995-2009. The study finds that GDP is positively influenced by health indicators in the long run and health indicators cause the per capita GDP. It reveals that health indicators have a long run impact on economic growth. Thus, the impact of health is a long run phenomenon .The major policy implication of the study is that, a high level of economic growth can be achieved by improving the health status of the populace, especially if the current status is at low ebb. Introduction The relationship between human capital and economic growth has received generous enquiries in the literature .The significance of Human capital in achieving sustainable economic Growth has been documented. Growth theories suggest the role of human capital in achieving significant growth in the economy. The economic view of human capital encompasses education, health, training, migration, and other investments that enhance an individual's productivity. Outcome from several studies seem to suggest that there is a positive correlation between health status and sustainable economic growth. The wide acceptance of this nexus prompted the prominence of health outcome in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In fact three of the goals are health specific while the others can also be regarded as health enhancing. Thus, the development of human capital becomes more important in many resource constraint countries like Nigeria. The opportunity costs of spending on health is very high and thus the need for a justification on the increase or otherwise of health spending in Nigeria. Incidentally, Nigeria is among the developing nations with poor health outcomes and its attendant problems. The health status of Nigeria is still considerably low and exists below that of some countries in West Africa. Low life expectancy at birth, high infant and maternal mortality rates, malaria and tuberculosis afflictions are some of the characteristics features of theNigeriàs health status. Life expectancy at birth in Nigeria was estimated at only 48 in 2007, compared with 56 in Ghana. This is complemented by the high numbers of women who die of complications during pregnancy or childbirth. Although the global maternal mortality ratio of below 400 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2008, the maternal mortality ratio for Nigeria was 1100 per 100 000 live births, still on the high when compared to 560 and 910 in Ghana and Guinea respectively. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS among adults aged 15 and above infection has contributed significantly to Nigeria's low life expectancy (WHO 2010). It was estimated at 2,886 per 100,000 people. It is above the Prevalence rate in Ghana (1722), but below that of Cameroun (4580). Also, the per capital income in Nigeria is low, with more than half of the population leaving below the poverty line. Thus, provision of adequate funding for health care either by the household or the government remains difficult. Most of the literatures that have incorporated human capital in the growth studies, tends to Paid greater attention on analysing the impact of education on economic growth, while ignoring the role of health human capital. It is only in very recent times that studies have started looking at health and tried to estimate the relationship between health status and economic growth. There exists a two-way relationship between improved health and economic growth. Health and other forms of human and physical capital increases the per capita GDP by increasing productivity of existing resources coupled with resource accumulation and technical change. Furthermore, some part of this increased income is spent on investment in human capital, which results in further per capita growth. On the other hand, Economic development results in improved nutrition, better sanitation, innovations in medical technologies; all this increases the life expectancy, reduces the infant mortality rate. Akram (2008). Therefore, this paper seeks to investigate and established the relationship that exists between health and per capita GDP in the long-run. This study will further test whether, there exists a two-way causality between health and per capita GDP or causality is unidirectional given conflicting results in the literatures. 2. Nigeria Health Care Sector Health services are provided by the private and public sectors. From private sector, there are non-governmental organization, private for-profit providers, community-based organization and religious and traditional care givers. Government assumes the responsibility of health service provision in public sector. The provision of health services in public sectors are at three levels namely the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary.

In recent years changes have been introduced into the design of CT programmes that go some way towards addressing this concern. This article critically engages the meaning of transformative social protection and introduces a collection of papers that examine whether and under what conditions cash transfers can be 'transformative'. Among the issues addressed are whether CTs can be catalysts leading to positive changes, material, subjective and relational in the lives of poor people; what are the social effects of CTs for beneficiaries, their households and communities; and can they foster horizontal relationships within communities and vertical relationship with the state through developing forms of social accountability and citizenship engagement?},

   abstract = {Abstract Can microfinance borrowers use the discipline of regular loan repayments in order to accumulate savings if prompted to do so? In an experiment, we offered commercial savings products to the microfinance borrowers of Guatemala’s largest public-sector bank. We find that giving these borrowers the opportunity to develop a savings plan and be reminded of saving at the time of loan repayment caused no increase in the opening of savings accounts but led to balances among savers that were two and a half times those in the control. A second treatment arm that proposed a default savings contribution of 10% of the loan payment caused the fraction of clients using linked savings accounts to double, as well as elevated deposits among savers, leading to final savings balances that were more than five times the control. The savings treatments also generate faster pay down of debt and weakly better overall repayment performance, suggesting that simultaneous saving and borrowing can be complementary activities. A theoretical model shows that the simultaneous provision of debt and self-commitment savings products can also help a larger fraction of the population to eventually escape a debt-financed equilibrium.

Overall, entrepreneurship programs have a positive and large impact for youth and on business knowledge and practice, but no immediate translation into business set- up and expansion or increased income.

In addition, financing support appears more effective for women and business training for existing entrepreneurs than other interventions to improve business performance.},

   abstract = {Forty decades of sociological stress research offer five major findings. First, when stressors (negative events, chronic strains, and traumas) are measured comprehensively, their damaging impacts on physical and mental health are substantial. Second, differential exposure to stressful experiences is a primary way that gender, racial-ethnic, marital status, and social class inequalities in physical and mental health are produced. Third, minority group members are additionally harmed by discrimination stress. Fourth, stressors proliferate over the life course and across generations, widening health gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged group members. Fifth, the impacts of stressors on health and well-being are reduced when persons have high levels of mastery, self-esteem, and/or social support. With respect to policy, to help individuals cope with adversity, tried and true coping and support interventions should be more widely disseminated and employed. To address health inequalities, the structural conditions that put people at risk of stressors should be a focus of programs and policies at macro and meso levels of intervention. Programs and policies also should target children who are at lifetime risk of ill health and distress due to exposure to poverty and stressful family circumstances.},

   abstract = {Consumers need information to compare alternatives for markets to function efficiently. Recognizing this, public policies often pair competition with easy access to comparative information. The implicit assumption is that comparison friction-the wedge between the availability of comparative information and consumers' use of it-is inconsequential because when information is readily available, consumers will access this information and make effective choices. We examine the extent of comparison friction in the market for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the United States. In a randomized field experiment, an intervention group received a letter with personalized cost information. That information was readily available for free and widely advertised. However, this additional step-providing the information rather than having consumers actively access it-had an impact. Plan switching was 28% in the intervention group, versus 17% in the comparison group, and the intervention caused an average decline in predicted consumer cost of about $100 a year among letter recipients-roughly 5% of the cost in the comparison group. Our results suggest that comparison friction can be large even when the cost of acquiring information is small and may be relevant for a wide range of public policies that incorporate consumer choice. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the President and Fellows of HarvardCollege 2012.},

   abstract = {Most analyses of the impact of expanding Medicaid focus on the direct costs of the program from increased health expenditures and the direct benefits from improved health and reduced exposure to medical expenditure risk. In this paper, we consider possible additional impacts of Medicaid on enrollees' labor market activity and take-up of government benefits such as disability insurance and welfare. As states face choices about expanding their Medicaid programs, these indirect effects could create important additional costs and benefits. A priori, however, the sign, let alone the magnitude, of the effects of Medicaid on labor market activity and program participation is unclear. There are a number of potential channels through which Medicaid coverage could increase employment and decrease participation in other government programs. For example, by improving health or reducing disruptive health emergencies, Medicaid coverage could increase employment, hours worked, wages, and earnings. Higher earnings could in turn reduce receipt of benefits from social safety net programs, particularly those that are means-tested. There are also non-earnings channels through which Medicaid could decrease participation in other public programs. Improved health could reduce eligibility for disability-based programs. Public health insurance coverage might reduce the benefit from (and hence participation in) other programs that provide access to public health insurance (such as various disability programs). Some thus hope that expanding Medicaid will raise incomes, increase government income tax},

By using the randomization provided by the lottery and emergency-department records from Portland-area hospitals, we studied the emergency department use of about 25,000 lottery participants over about 18 months after the lottery. We found that Medicaid coverage significantly increases overall emergency use by 0.41 visits per person, or 40% relative to an average of 1.02 visits per person in the control group.

A rigorous approach involves setting up a hypothesis testing scenario using the performance of the systems on query documents. However, often the hypothesis testing approach needs to send a large number of document queries to the systems, which can be problematic. In this paper, we present an effective alternative based on the multi-armed bandit (MAB). We propose a hierarchical gen-erative model to represent the uncertainty in the performance measures of the competing systems, to be used by Thompson Sampling to solve the resulting MAB. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that our approach requires significantly fewer queries compared to the standard benchmarking technique to identify the best system according to F-measure.},

Our empirical strategy relies on a dichotomous measure of democracy coded from several sources to reduce measurement error and controls for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of GDP, which otherwise confound the effect of democracy on economic growth. Our baseline results use a dynamic panel model for GDP, and show that democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20% in the long run. We find similar results when we estimate the effect of democratizations on GDP year-by-year, controlling for the GDP dynamics linearly or using the estimated propensity to democratize based on past GDP dynamics. We obtain comparable estimates using regional waves of democratizations and reversals to instrument for democracy. Our results suggest that democracy increases future GDP by encouraging investment, increasing schooling, inducing economic reforms, improving public good provision, and reducing social unrest. We find little support for the view that democracy is a constraint on economic growth for less developed economies.},

To extract numerous and diverse concepts, such as data elements (i.e., important concepts related to a certain medical condition), a plausible solution is to combine various NLP tools into an ensemble to improve extraction performance. However, it is unclear to what extent ensembles of popular NLP tools improve the extraction of numerous and diverse concepts. Therefore, we built an NLP ensemble pipeline to synergize the strength of popular NLP tools using seven ensemble methods, and to quantify the improvement in performance achieved by ensembles in the extraction of data elements for three very different cohorts. Evaluation results show that the pipeline can improve the performance of NLP tools, but there is high variability depending on the cohort.},

Study design: This was a prospective study of parents of infants born at <32 weeks' gestation with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia and approaching neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge. Parents were presented a hypothetical scenario of an infant who failed weaning to room air and 2 options: discharge with home oxygen or try longer to wean oxygen. The initial scenario risks reflected a 1.5-week difference in NICU length of stay and no differences in other outcomes. Length of stay and readmission outcomes were increased or decreased until the parent switched preference. Three months after discharge, parents were asked to reconsider their preference. Differences were analyzed by χ2 or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Of 125 parents, 50% preferred home oxygen. For parents preferring home oxygen, the most important reason was comfort at home (79%). Forty percent switched preference when the length of stay difference decreased by 1 week; 35% switched when readmission increased by 5%. For parents preferring to stay in NICU, the most important reason was fear of taking care of the child at home (73%). Thirty-two percent switched preference when the length of stay difference increased by 1 week; 31% switched when readmission decreased by 5%. One hundred ten parents completed the 3-month follow-up; 80 were discharged with home oxygen. Seventy-eight percent would prefer home oxygen (97% who initially preferred home oxygen and 60% who initially preferred to stay in the NICU). Conclusions: Parents weigh differences in NICU length of stay and readmission risk similarly. After discharge, most prefer earlier discharge with home oxygen. Earlier education to increase comfort with home technology may facilitate NICU discharge planning.},

In this paper, we first examine the small-sample properties of the specification tests for testing the validity of instrumental variables (IVs). Second, we investigate the effects of using different numbers of IVs. Our results show that specification tests derived for continuous data are extremely oversized at all sample sizes when applied to ordinal variables. Possible modifications for ordinal data are proposed in the present study. Simulation results show that the modified specification tests with all available IVs are able to detect model misspecification. In terms of estimation accuracy, the PIV approach where the IVs outnumber the endogenous variables by one produces a lower bias but a higher variation than the PIV approach with more IVs for correctly specified factor loadings at small samples.},

We argue that a reverse effect of job satisfaction on career adaptability, originating from affective tendencies tied to personality, might explain this null effect. Our argument implies that the estimates obtained with traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions are biased by endogeneity, a correlation between an explanatory variable and the error term in a regression model. When experimental manipulations are impossible, IV estimations, such as two-stage least squares (2SLS) regressions, are one possible solution to the endogeneity problem. Analyzing three waves of data from a sample of 836 adults, the concurrent and time-lagged effect of job satisfaction on career adaptability was revealed to be more consistent than the reverse. Our results provide an explanation, rooted in affective dispositions, as to why recent meta-analytical estimates unexpectedly found that career adaptability does not predict job satisfaction at the interindividual level. We also discuss IV estimation in terms of its limits, weight the interpretation of its estimates against the temporality criterion for causal inference, and consider its possible extension to analyses of change.},

   abstract = {Control of the lower urinary tract is a complex, multilevel process that involves both the peripheral and central nervous system. Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is a widespread chronic illness that impairs millions of people worldwide. Neurogenic LUTD has a major impact on quality of life, affecting emotional, social, sexual, occupational and physical aspects of daily life, and in addition to the debilitating manifestations for patients, it also imposes a substantial economic burden on every healthcare system. First-line treatment for neurogenic LUTD includes antimuscarinics and some form of catheterization, preferably intermittent self-catheterization. However, the treatment effect is often unsatisfactory, so that other options have to be considered. Moreover, neurogenic LUTD is a challenge because all available treatment modalities (i.e. conservative, minimally invasive and invasive therapies) may fail. In recent years, botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) treatment has been shown to be an effective pharmacological therapy option in patients refractory to antimuscarinic and neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). Several studies have shown that BoNT/A injection significantly reduces detrusor muscle overactivity. Also BoNT/A treatment of NDO has revealed a significant improvement of lower urinary tract function with regard to reduced urinary incontinence, reduced detrusor pressure, increased bladder capacity and improved quality of life in NDO. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate urodynamic (UD) parameters that predict outcome of intradetrusor botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) injection in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO), by reviewing clinical and UD data. METHODS 56 cases of the first BTX-A intradetrusor injection were performed in pediatric patients with NDO. We excluded 19 cases based on these criteria: patient age <4 years, no preoperative UD study or postoperative outcome assessment, and simultaneous sphincter injection. Based on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement, patients were classified as responders or nonresponders. RESULTS Thirty-seven cases were included finally. Mean number of pads used per day was significantly decreased after BTX-A injection (2.67 AE 1.46 vs 1.37 AE 1.15; P <.001). On postoperative UD study, maximum cystometric capacity and residual urine volume were significantly increased above baseline. Persistent NDO was only detected in 3 cases (8.1%). Regardless of UD improvements , 20 cases were responders, whereas 17 were nonresponders based on Patient Global Impression of Improvement. Preoperative bladder compliance was significantly lower in non-responders (25.11 AE 32.59 vs 8.64 AE 6.52; P ¼ .039). Open bladder neck (OBN) was seen in 9 cases and more likely occurred in nonresponders. Regression analysis revealed that poor bladder compliance (<10 mL/cm H 2 O; odds ratio, 6.041; 95% confidence interval, 1.189-30.677; P ¼ .030) and presence of OBN (odds ratio, 16.889; 95% confidence interval, 1.825-156.282; P ¼ .031) were independent predictors of poor response after BTX-A injection. CONCLUSION Preoperative bladder compliance and OBN were important predictors of outcome after BTX-A intradetrusor injection. Thus, intradetrusor BTX-A injection should be considered in select patients to achieve optimal outcome. UROLOGY 84: 1480e1484,},

   abstract = {Background: We have observed different clinical responses to botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) in patients who had similar urodynamic parameters before the procedure. Furthermore, some bladders evaluated by cystography and cystoscopy during the procedure had different characteristics that could influence the outcome of the treatment. The aim of this study was to assess whether cystography and urodynamic parameters could help predict which patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) refractory to anticholinergics respond better to treatment with injection of BTX-A. Methods. In total, 34 patients with spinal cord injury were prospectively evaluated. All patients emptied their bladder by clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and had incontinence and NDO, despite using 40 mg or more of intravesical oxybutynin and undergoing detrusor injection of BTX-A (300 IU). Pretreatment evaluation included urodynamic, and cystography. Follow-up consisted of urodynamic and ambulatory visits four months after treatment. The cystography parameters used were bladder shape, capacity and presence of diverticula. Urodynamic parameters used for assessment were maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), maximum detrusor pressure (MDP), compliance and reflex volume (RV). Results: After injection of BTX-A, 70% of the patients had success, with 4 months or more of continence. Before the treatment, there were significant differences in most urodynamic parameters between those who responded successfully compared to those who did not. Patients who responded successfully had greater MCC (p = 0.019), higher RV (p = 0.041), and greater compliance (p = 0.043). There was no significant difference in the MDP (0.691). The cystography parameters were not significantly different between these groups bladder shape (p = 0.271), capacity (p > 0.720) and presence of diverticula (p > 0.999). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20.0) and included Student's t-test for two paired samples and Fisher's exact test, with a significance threshold of 0.05. Conclusions: This study suggests that the cystography parameters evaluated cannot be used to help predict the response to injection of BTX-A in the treatment of refractory NDO. However, the urodynamic parameters were significantly different in patients who responded to the treatment, with the exception of the MDP.},

Most patients have improvements in symptoms, urodynamic parameters, and quality of life, and a poor response is uncommon. The aim of this study was to determine whether poor responders could be predicted from preoperative urodynamic parameters. Methods: Data were collected prospectively from 33 OAB patients with idiopathic detrusor overactivity. All patients underwent intradetrusor injections of 200 U BTX-A. Response to treatment was assessed by patient perception, OAB symptoms, and quality of life data. Urodynamics were conducted at baseline and 4, 12, and 24 weeks postinjection. We performed statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon matched pairs, Mann-Whitney, two-sample, and paired t-tests. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for relevant parameters. Results: Five patients had a poor response to treatment. Significant increases in maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), reflex detrusor volume (RDV), and bladder compliance with decreases in maximum detrusor pressures (MDP) on filling were observed in the responders over 24 weeks. Minimal urodynamic benefit was observed in the poor responders group over the same period. When comparing the two groups, baseline MDP in poor responders was 138.0 ± 30.7 compared with 74.4 ± 32.6 in the responders (P = 0.0028). ROC analysis suggested that a pretreatment MDP greater than 110 may have predictive value (AUC, 0.946; sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 1.0) for a poor response to treatment. Conclusions: Very high MDP greater than 110 may predict a poor response to treatment with 200 U of BTX-A. Higher doses may be necessary in these patients. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) proved very effective in therapy for hyperactive detrusor or sphincter dysfunction of neurogenic and non-neurogenic origin. However, therapy may fail. In a search for possible reasons, we investigated the presence of BoNT/A antibodies (BoNT/A-AB) in patients who were treated more than once and correlated the presence of antibodies with clinical findings. Methods: In 25 patients (aged 11-75 years; average, 48.3 years) who had experienced at least one previous BoNT/A detrusor and/or sphincter injection, BoNT/A-AB was detected with the mouse diaphragm assay before and within 3 months after the current injection. Clinically, subjective and objective outcomes of this injection session were determined on an efficacy scale. Results: In eight patients, BoNT/A-AB was detected; titers were clearly positive in four patients and were borderline in four patients. The subjective and objective outcomes indicated complete therapy failure in three of four patients who were positive for BoNT/A-AB. In two patients, BoNT/A-AB developed after just one injection session. Conclusions: Botulinum toxin type A antibodies can develop after injection of BoNT/A for urologic disorders and the antibodies can lead to therapy failure. In patients with clinically complete therapy failure in whom no obvious other causes can be determined (such as a progressive disease in a patient with multiple sclerosis), screening for BoNT/A-AB should be carried out. © 2008 The Japanese Urological Association.},

Methods: This prospective study included 15 children with myelodysplasia who underwent intradetrusor BoNT-A injections due to neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDOA). Urine samples of each child were collected before and after BoNT-A injections, specifically at the first and third postoperative months. Urine samples were analyzed with ELISA method and NGF, TGF-Beta-1, and TIMP-2 levels were measured. Urine marker levels and clinical findings were assessed for statistical significance with Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test and Friedman Test. Results: A total of 15 children (5 boys and 10 girls) were assigned as the study group. Mean age of the patients was 7.1 ± 2.5 years (range 2.5-11). A statistically significantly decline was observed in urinary TGF-Beta-1 and NGF levels following BoNT-A injections, compared to the preoperative levels (P < 0.05). TIMP-2 levels also tend to decrease following BoNT-A injections but this was not statistically significant compared to the preoperative levels. Conclusion: This preliminary study, suggests urinary TGF-Beta-1 and NGF as a potent marker in children with NDOA, as they decline following BoNT-A injection. Further studies are needed in identifying their special role in assessing treatment success after invasive interventions.},

   abstract = {Since the establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 1990, the Chinese stock market has continued to develop in the process of deepening reforms and is of great significance to China's economic progress. Unlike the mature markets in western developed countries, there are many individual investors participating in the Chinese stock market, which makes it highly volatile. The most recent stock market crash occurred in 2015 and caused a huge negative impact on the household sector. This paper assesses the impact of stock market crash on households' financial income and consumption. We find that the financial income of households holding risky assets decreased significantly, and the financial literacy and investment experience did not play a positive role in the experience of stock market crash. In terms of consumption, households with different risk attitudes and financial literacy have significant differences in whether they choose smoother consumption decisions after this shock. Finally, based on the empirical results, we estimate that the stock market crash caused the consumption of residents in 2016 to decrease by 87.53 billion RMB, accounting for 0.30% of the total consumption of residents.},

   abstract = {LASSO for variable selection in linear regression has been studied by many authors. To achieve asymptotic selection consistency, it is well known that the LASSO method requires a strong irrepresentable condition. Even adding a thresholding step after LASSO is still too conservative, especially when the number of explanatory variables p is much larger than the number of observations n. Another well-known method, the sure independence screening (SIS), applies thresholding to an estimator of marginal covariate effect vector and, therefore, is not selection consistent unless the zero components of the marginal covariate effect vector are asymptotically the same as the zero components of the regression effect vector. Since the weakness of LASSO is caused by the fact that it utilizes the covariate sample covariance matrix that is not well behaved when p is larger than n, we propose a regularized LASSO (RLASSO) method for replacing the co-variate sample covariance matrix in LASSO by a regularized estimator of covariate covariance matrix and adding a thresholding step. Using a regularized estimator of covariate covariance matrix, we can consistently estimate the regression effects and, hence, our method also extends and improves the SIS method that estimates marginal covariate effects. We establish selection consistency of RLASSO under conditions that the regression effect vector is sparse and the covariate covariance matrix or its inverse is sparse. Some simulation results for comparing variable selection performances of RLASSO and various other methods are presented. A data example is also provided.},

Materials and Methods: Men were asked to complete an AUA-SI survey and answer a symmetrical response framework question to evaluate their global perception of change in lower urinary tract symptoms at each interval, namely, “Are your urinary symptoms much better, slightly better, the same, slightly worse, or much worse compared to your prior visit?” Median changes and interquartile ranges (IQRs) in the AUA-SI scores were compared with the global evaluation response for the entire cohort. Additionally, outcomes were stratified by baseline AUA-SI severity classification (mild, moderate, or severe). Results: The median changes and IQRs in AUA-SI scores of patients rating themselves as much better, slightly better, the same, slightly worse, and much worse compared with their symptoms at the time of their last AUA-SI were −2 (IQR −6 to 0), −1 (IQR −5 to 1), 0 (IQR −2 to 2), 5 (IQR 0-9), and 11 (IQR 5-18), respectively. There was a significant difference in AUA-SI score change between each rating category (P <.001). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the patients require only a small decrease in their AUA-SI scores to report they are slightly better or much better, whereas a larger increase in their AUA-SI scores is required for patients to report their symptoms are slightly worse or much worse.},

Image augmentation was employed on the training dataset to increase the number of training images. The general network architecture consisted of three convolutional layers plus batch normalization and dropout layers to avoid over fitting. Results: The validation based on 45 datasets not used for model training revealed that the proposed deep convolutional neural network is capable of identifying and differentiating between normal tympanic membranes, tympanostomy tubes, and cerumen impactions with an overall accuracy of 84.4%.},

The minimally important difference (MID) provides a measure of the smallest change in the PRO that patients perceive as important. An anchor-based approach is the most appropriate method for MID determination. No study or database currently exists that provides all anchor-based MIDs associated with PRO instruments; nor are there any accepted standards for appraising the credibility of MID estimates. Our objectives are to complete a systematic survey of the literature to collect and characterise published anchor-based MIDs associated with PRO instruments used in evaluating the effects of interventions on chronic medical and psychiatric conditions and to assess their credibility. Methods and analysis: We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO (1989 to present) to identify studies addressing methods to estimate anchor-based MIDs of target PRO instruments or reporting empirical ascertainment of anchor-based MIDs. Teams of two reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, review full texts of citations, and extract relevant data. On the basis of findings from studies addressing methods to estimate anchor-based MIDs, we will summarise the available methods and develop an instrument addressing the credibility of empirically ascertained MIDs. We will evaluate the credibility of all studies reporting on the empirical ascertainment of anchor-based MIDs using the credibility instrument, and assess the instrument's inter-rater reliability. We will separately present reports for adult and paediatric populations.},

However, its computational and storage costs are still expensive for high-dimensional data. To address these problems, in this paper, we consider a 2D compressed learning paradigm to learn the SMM classifier in some compressed data domain. Specifically, we use the Kro-necker compressed sensing (KCS) to obtain the compressive measurements and learn the SMM classifier. We show that the Kronecker product measurement matrices used by KCS satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), which is a property to ensure the learnability of the compressed data. We further give a lower bound on the number of measurements required for KCS. Though this lower bound shows that KCS requires more measurements than the regular CS to satisfy the same RIP condition, KCS itself still enjoys lower computational and storage complexities. Then, using the RIP condition, we verify that the learned SMM classifier in the compressed domain can perform almost as well as the best linear classifier in the original uncompressed domain. Finally, our experimental results also demonstrate the feasibility of 2D compressed learning.},

   abstract = {Covariance estimation for high-dimensional datasets is a fundamental problem in machine learning, and has numerous applications. In these high-dimensional settings the number of features or variables p is typically larger than the sample size n. A popular way of tackling this challenge is to induce sparsity in the covariance matrix, its inverse or a relevant transformation. In many applications, the data come with a natural ordering. In such settings, methods inducing sparsity in the Cholesky parameter of the inverse covariance matrix can be quite useful. Such methods are also better positioned to yield a positive definite estimate of the covariance matrix, a critical requirement for several downstream applications. Despite some important advances in this area, a principled approach to general sparse-Cholesky based covariance estimation with both statistical and algorithmic convergence safeguards has been elusive. In particular, the two popular likelihood based methods proposed in the literature either do not lead to a well-defined estimator in high-dimensional settings, or consider only a restrictive class of models. In this paper, we propose a principled and general method for sparse-Cholesky based covariance estimation that aims to overcome some of the shortcomings of current methods, but retains their respective strengths. We obtain a jointly convex formulation for our objective function, and show that it leads to rigorous convergence guarantees and well-defined estimators, even when p > n. Very importantly, the approach always leads to a positive definite and symmetric estimator of the covariance matrix. We establish both high-dimensional estimation and selection consistency, and also demonstrate excellent finite sample performance on simulated/real data.},

Methods: Individual-level utilities derived from primary 5L data using both value set (5L) and crosswalk (c5L) approaches were applied to three Markov models assessing the cost-effectiveness of hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients to estimate incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The mathematic functions between incremental QALY and utility were derived. Results: 5L-and c5L-based incremental QALYs were similar in the model for non-diabetic patients (range: 1.910e2.149, 1.922e2.121). 5L tends to generate more incremental QALYs than c5L in the model for diabetic patients (range: 1.454e1.633, 1.365e1.568) but fewer incre-mental QALYs in the model for all ESRD patients (range: 0.290e0.480, 0.315e0.493). In all models, 5L (c5L) generated more incremental QALYs when Chinese (South Korean) value sets were used. The largest and smallest differences in 5L-and c5L-based incremental QALYs were observed when Chinese and Dutch value sets were used. Incremental QALYs was a positive linear function of both utility of PD and difference in utilities of HD and PD. Conclusions: The value set and crosswalk approaches may not be used interchangeably in economic evaluation when EQ-5D-5L data are used to estimate utilities. Results of cost-effectiveness analysis using Markov models may be affected by both absolute utilities and their differences.},

   abstract = {Purpose: It has been argued that generic health-related quality of life measures are not sensitive to certain disease-specific improvements; condition-specific preference-based measures may offer a better alternative. This paper assesses the validity, responsiveness and sensitivity of a cancer-specific preference-based measure, the EORTC-8D, relative to the EQ-5D-3L. Methods: A longitudinal prospective population-based cancer genomic cohort, Cancer 2015, was utilised in the analysis. EQ-5D-3L and the EORTC QLQ-C30 (which gives EORTC-8D values) were asked at baseline (diagnosis) and at various follow-up points (3 months, 6 months, 12 months). Baseline values were assessed for convergent validity, ceiling effects, agreement and sensitivity. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated and similarly assessed. Multivariate regression analyses were employed to understand the determinants of the difference in QALYs. Results: Complete case analysis of 1678 patients found that the EQ-5D-3L values at baseline were significantly lower than the EORTC-8D values (0.748 vs 0.829, p < 0.001). While the correlation between the instruments was high, agreement between the instruments was poor. The baseline health state values using both instruments were found to be sensitive to a number of patient and disease characteristics, and discrimination between disease states was found to be similar. Mean generic QALYs (estimated using the EQ-5D-3L) were significantly lower than condition-specific QALYs (estimated using the EORTC-8D) (0.860 vs 0.909, p < 0.001). The discriminatory power of both QALYs was similar. Conclusions: When comparing a generic and condition-specific preference-based instrument, divergences are apparent in both baseline health state values and in the estimated QALYs over time for cancer patients. The variability in sensitivity between the baseline values and the QALY estimations means researchers and decision makers are advised to be cautious if using the instruments interchangeably.},

   abstract = {Background-The EQ-5D is one of the most frequently used generic, preference-based instruments for measuring the health utilities of patients in economic evaluations. It is recommended for health technology assessment by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Because the EQ-5D plays such an important role in economic evaluations, useful information on its responsiveness to detect meaningful change in health status is required. Objective-This study systematically reviewed and synthesized evidence on the responsiveness of the EQ-5D to detect meaningful change in health status for clinical research and economic evaluations. Methods-We searched the EuroQol website, PubMed, PsychINFO, and EconLit databases to identify studies published in English from the inception of the EQ-5D until August 15, 2014 using keywords that were related to responsiveness. Studies that used only the EQ-VAS were excluded from the final analysis. Narrative synthesis was conducted to summarize evidence on the responsiveness of the EQ-5D by conditions or physiological functions. Results-Of 1,401 studies, 145 were included in the narrative synthesis and categorized into 19 categories for 56 conditions. The EQ-5D was found to be responsive in 25 conditions (45%) with the magnitude of responsiveness varying from small to large depending on the condition. There was mixed evidence of responsiveness in 27 conditions (48%). Only four conditions (7%) (i.e., alcohol dependency, schizophrenia, limb reconstruction, and hearing impairment) were identified where the EQ-5D was not responsive. Conclusion-The EQ-5D is an appropriate measure for economic evaluation and health technology assessment in conditions where it has demonstrated evidence of responsiveness. In conditions with mixed evidence of responsiveness, researchers should consider using the EQ-5D with other condition-specific measures to ensure appropriate estimates of effectiveness. These conditions should be a main focus for future research using the new EQ-5D version with 5 response levels.},

   abstract = {Objective: Resource allocation informed by cost-utility analysis requires that the benefits be comparable across patient groups and interventions. One option is to recommend the use of one generic utility measure, but this raises the issue of comparability when the preferred measure is inappropriate or unavailable. Many cancer trials do not include generic measures such as the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire and instead include condition-specific measures and use these to generate utility estimates. We analyze the comparability of generic, condition-specific, and mapped utility values for a multiple myeloma cancer patient data set. Methods: Generic EQ-5D, condition-specific EORTC-8D, and EQ-5D utility values mapped from the EORTC QLQ-C30 were compared by using psycho-metric and statistical analysis to determine discrimination across severity groups, responsiveness, and agreement. Results: Generic, condition-specific, and mapped utility estimates were responsive over time and show discriminative validity. The EQ-5D had higher responsiveness and detected a greater change across severity groups and treatment periods than did the EORTC-8D but has a higher proportion of responses at full health (12.8%). Differences in the EQ-5D and the EORTC-8D were due at least in part to differences in the classification system. Mapped EQ-5D estimates had a smaller SD and do not reflect the severe range of health states reported by using the EQ-5D. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that condition-specific EORTC-8D or mapped EQ-5D utility estimates are broadly comparable to directly obtained EQ-5D utilities for a multiple myeloma patient data set. However, EORTC-8D estimates captured changes in quality of life for patients in mild health states that were not captured by the EQ-5D, but estimated lower utility gains than did the use of the EQ-5D directly.},

   abstract = {Effect of various patient and treatment related factors on the outcome with respect to xerostomia and dysphagia were analyzed. Results: Fifty one consecutive eligible patients participated in this prospective study. There were 48 males and 3 females (median age 54 years). Median treatment to evaluation time (follow up) for the entire group was 50 months (2−201months). Forty seven patients had received combined EBRT and BRT while 4 patients received BRT alone. EBRT was delivered using standard portals with a median dose of 44 Gy/22 fractions over 4 weeks. BRT was low dose rate in 23 patients and high dose rate in 28 patients. Median dose of BRT was 30 Gy with LDR and 20 Gy with HDR BRT. The median xerostomia score was only 16 (Range: 0−73) suggestive of recovery of the salivary glands. There was no difference in the xerostomia while eating (stimulated) vs at rest (basal) for the entire population. Xerostomia scores in patients treated with LDR BRT vs HDR BRT were comparable. XQ scores compared favorably with published results using the same questionnaire after intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) (Meirovitz 2006). Median dysphagia score was 2.4 (Range 1.4−3) for the entire population indicating good swallowing status post BRT. There was significant correlation between the xerostomia and the dysphagia scores (<0.001). Conclusion: Patient reported xerostomia was consistently low with usage of brachytherapy both at rest (basal) and while eating (stimulated) signifying organ and function preservation. Significant correlation of dysphagia and xerostomia scores suggests that xerostomia and dysphagia are closely interrelated. 8539 POSTER Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 (TPS) followed by proton therapy concurrent with cisplatin in the patients with T4 nasal cavity cancer Background: In the treatment of the patients (pts) with T4 nasal cavity cancer, definitive chemoradiotherapy was contraindicated due to the risk of brain damage or blindness. The chemotherapy combination with docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 (TPS) has shown to be well tolerated and active (Tahara M, ASCO2007, 2009). We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of induction chemotherapy of TPS followed by proton therapy (PBT) concurrent with cisplatin in pts with T4 nasal cavity cancer. Methods: Fourteen pts with T4 nasal cavity cancer treated with induction chemotherapy of TPS were analyzed. TPS consisted of 1-hour infusion of docetaxel at 60 to 70 mg/m 2 , 2-hour infusions of cisplatin at 70 mg/m 2 /day on day 1 and S-1 twice daily on days 1−14 at 60 to 80 mg/m 2 /day. The treatment was repeated every 3 or 4-weeks with maximum number of treatment cycle of 3 cycles. According to the response of TPS, pts received either PBT concurrent with cisplatin or PBT alone. Results: Nine males and 5 females; median age of 45.7 years (22−60); 7 olfactory neuroblastoma, 3 SCC and 4 others; 14 intracranial invasion and 5 optic nerve invasion. Median cycle of TPS was 2.6. Most common grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities were neutropenia (59.4%). Most common grade3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities were nausea (13.5%). After the completion of TPS, 1 achieved complete response and 5 achieved partial response with an overall response rate of 42.8%. Of the 14 pts after receiving TPS, 11 received PBT concurrent with cisplatin, 2 received PBT alone and one received palliative radiation. No severe toxicity was observed during PBT. After the completion of PBT, 11 pts achieved complete response and 1 pts have not yet confirmed response. No brain damage or blindness was seen. Conclusion: Induction chemotherapy of TPS followed by PBT concurrent with cisplatin was well tolerated. The antitumor activity is very promising, and this warrants further investigation.

Methods and Materials: Between January 1987 and July 2005, 85 patients with PNS and nasal cavity cancer underwent postoperative RT. Most patients had squamous cell carcinoma (49%; n 42), T4 tumors (52%; n 36), and the maxillary sinus (53%; n 45) as the primary disease site. The median radiation dose was 63 Gy.

Acute and late toxicities were scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Results: With a median follow-up for surviving patients of 60 months, the 5-year estimates of local progression-free, regional progression-free, distant metastasis-free, disease-free, and overall survival rates were 62%, 87%, 82%, 55%, and 67%, respectively.

This entry provides an overview of DIF.

For an introduction to the IRT features in Stata, we encourage you to read [IRT] irt first. Investigating DIF involves evaluating whether a test item behaves differently across respondents with the same value of the latent trait. An item "functions differently" across individuals with the same latent trait level if these individuals have different probabilities of selecting a given response. A good overview of DIF procedures can be found in Penfield and Camilli (2007) and Osterlind and Everson (2009). Holland and Wainer (1993) provide a thorough treatment of statistical methodologies and practical issues surrounding DIF analysis. It is convenient to illustrate DIF using item characteristic curves even though many DIF diagnostics are not based on fitting an IRT model. These include the Mantel-Haenszel test available in difmh and the logistic regression test available in diflogistic. By convention, the hypothesized disadvantaged individuals are categorized as the focal group, and the advantaged ones are categorized as the reference group. The graph below shows an example of uniform DIF. The item favors the reference group over the entire range of the latent trait (ability). For example, given ability = 0, the probability of getting the item right is 0.73 for an individual from the reference group but only 0.50 for an individual from the focal group.},

   abstract = {Various methods to detect differential item functioning (DIF) in item response models are available. However, most of these methods assume that the responses are binary, and so for ordered response categories available methods are scarce. In the present article, DIF in the widely used partial credit model is investigated. An item-focused tree is proposed that allows the detection of DIF items, which might affect the performance of the partial credit model. The method uses tree methodology, yielding a tree for each item that is detected as DIF item. The visualization as trees makes the results easily accessible, as the obtained trees show which variables induce DIF and in which way. In the present paper, the new method is compared with alternative approaches and simulations demonstrate the performance of the method.},

   abstract = {Differential item functioning (DIF) indicates the violation of the invariance assumption, for instance, in models based on item response theory (IRT). For item-wise DIF analysis using IRT, a common metric for the item parameters of the groups that are to be compared (e.g., for the reference and the focal group) is necessary. In the Rasch model, therefore, the same linear restriction is imposed in both groups. Items in the restriction are termed the ``anchor items''. Ideally, these items are DIF-free to avoid artificially augmented false alarm rates. However, the question how DIF-free anchor items are selected appropriately is still a major challenge. Furthermore, various authors point out the lack of new anchor selection strategies and the lack of a comprehensive study especially for dichotomous IRT models. This article reviews existing anchor selection strategies that do not require any knowledge prior to DIF analysis, offers a straightforward notation, and proposes three new anchor selection strategies. An extensive simulation study is conducted to compare the performance of the anchor selection strategies. The results show that an appropriate anchor selection is crucial for suitable item-wise DIF analysis. The newly suggested anchor selection strategies outperform the existing strategies and can reliably locate a suitable anchor when the sample sizes are large enough.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this simulation study is to investigate the effects of anchor subtest composition on the accuracy of item response theory (IRT) likelihood ratio (LR) differential item functioning (DIF) detection (Thissen, Steinberg, & Wainer, 1988). Here, the IRT LR test was implemented with a free baseline approach wherein a baseline model was formed by freeing all items except a referent or anchor subset and examining the changes in fit with respect to a series of models wherein 1 item at a time was constrained in addition to the referent(s). The results clearly indicated that the composition of the anchor subtest is important for accurate DIF detection. It was found that using a single highly discriminating rather than a low discriminating referent greatly enhanced the power of the procedure. Moreover, in conditions involving small DIF or smaller sample sizes or both, power appeared to improve when a group of highly discriminating referents was used. These findings have implications for applied research involving short scales and small sample sizes.},

   abstract = {Background: Comparisons of population health status using self-report measures such as the SF-36 rest on the assumption that the measured items have a common interpretation across sub-groups. However, self-report measures may be sensitive to differential item functioning (DIF), which occurs when sub-groups with the same underlying health status have a different probability of item response. This study tested for DIF on the SF-36 physical functioning (PF) and mental health (MH) sub-scales in population-based data using latent variable mixture models (LVMMs). Methods: Data were from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos), a prospective national cohort study. LVMMs were applied to the ten PF and five MH SF-36 items. A standard two-parameter graded response model with one latent class was compared to multi-class LVMMs. Multivariable logistic regression models with pseudo-class random draws characterized the latent classes on demographic and health variables. Results: The CaMos cohort consisted of 9423 respondents. A three-class LVMM fit the PF sub-scale, with class proportions of 0.59, 0.24, and 0.17. For the MH sub-scale, a two-class model fit the data, with class proportions of 0.69 and 0.31. For PF items, the probabilities of reporting greater limitations were consistently higher in classes 2 and 3 than class 1. For MH items, respondents in class 2 reported more health problems than in class 1. Differences in item thresholds and factor loadings between one-class and multi-class models were observed for both sub-scales. Demographic and health variables were associated with class membership. Conclusions: This study revealed DIF in population-based SF-36 data; the results suggest that PF and MH sub-scale scores may not be comparable across sub-groups defined by demographic and health status variables, although effects were frequently small to moderate in size. Evaluation of DIF should be a routine step when analysing population-based self-report data to ensure valid comparisons amongst sub-groups.},

   abstract = {Background Pelvic organ prolapse is a common condition that frequently coexists with urinary and fecal incontinence. The impact of prolapse on quality of life is typically measured through condition-specific quality-of-life instruments. Utility preference scores are a standardized generic health-related quality-of-life measure that summarizes morbidity on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (optimum health). Utility preference scores quantify disease severity and burden and are widely used in cost-effectiveness research. The validity of utility preference instruments in women with pelvic organ prolapse has not been established. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of generic quality-of-life instruments for measuring utility scores in women with pelvic organ prolapse. Our hypothesis was that women with multiple pelvic floor disorders would have worse (lower) utility scores than women with pelvic organ prolapse only and that women with all 3 pelvic floor disorders would have the worst (lowest) utility scores. Study Design This was a prospective observational study of 286 women with pelvic floor disorders from a referral female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery practice. All women completed the following general health-related quality-of-life questionnaires: Health Utilities Index Mark 3, EuroQol, and Short Form 6D, as well as a visual analog scale. Pelvic floor symptom severity and condition-specific quality of life were measured using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, respectively. We measured the relationship between utility scores and condition-specific quality-of-life scores and compared utility scores among 4 groups of women: (1) pelvic organ prolapse only, (2) pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, (3) pelvic organ prolapse and urgency urinary incontinence, and (4) pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and fecal incontinence. Results Of 286 women enrolled, 191 (67%) had pelvic organ prolapse; mean age was 59 years and 73% were Caucasian. Among women with prolapse, 30 (16%) also had stress urinary incontinence, 39 (20%) had urgency urinary incontinence, and 42 (22%) had fecal incontinence. For the Health Utilities Index Mark 3, EuroQol, and Short Form 6D, the pattern in utility scores was noted to be lowest (worst) in the prolapse + urinary incontinence + fecal incontinence group (0.73-0.76), followed by the prolapse + urgency urinary incontinence group (0.77-0.85) and utility scores were the highest (best) for the prolapse only group (0.80-0.86). Utility scores from all generic instruments except the visual analog scale were significantly correlated with the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire total scores (r values –0.26 to –0.57), and prolapse, bladder, and bowel subscales (r values –0.16 to –0.50). Utility scores from all instruments except the visual analog scale were highly correlated with each other (r = 0.53-0.69, P <.0001). Conclusion The Health Utilities Index Mark 3, EuroQol, and Short Form 6D, but not the visual analog scale, provide valid measurements for utility scores in women with pelvic organ prolapse and associated pelvic floor disorders and could potentially be used for cost-effectiveness research.},

   abstract = {Background: Utility preference scores are standardized, generic, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures that quantify disease severity and burden and summarize morbidity on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (optimal health). Utility scores are widely used to measure HRQOL and in cost-effectiveness research. Objective: To determine the responsiveness, validity properties, and minimal important difference (MID) of utility scores, as measured by the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) and EuroQol (EQ-5D), in women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Materials and Methods: This study combined data from 4 large, U.S., multicenter surgical trials enrolling 1321 women with pelvic organ prolapse. We collected condition-specific quality of life data using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ). A subset of women completed the SF6D; women in 2 trials also completed the EQ5D. Mean utility scores were compared from baseline to 12 months after surgery. Responsiveness was assessed using effect size (ES) and standardized response mean (SRM). Validity properties were assessed by (1) comparing changes in utility scores at 12 months between surgical successes and failures as defined in each study, and (2) correlating changes in utility scores with changes in the PFDI and PFIQ. MID was estimated using both anchor-based (SF-36 general health global rating scale “somewhat better” vs “no change”) and distribution-based methods. Results: The mean SF-6D score improved 0.050, from 0.705 ± 0.126 at baseline to 0.761 ± 0.131 at 12 months (P < .01). The mean EQ-5D score improved 0.060, from 0.810 ± 0.15 at baseline to 0.868 ± 0.15 at 12 months (P < .01). The ES (0.13–0.61) and SRM (0.13–0.57) were in the small-to-moderate range, demonstrating the responsiveness of the SF-6D and EQ-5D similar to other conditions. SF-6D and EQ-5D scores improved more for prolapse reconstructive surgical successes than for failures. The SF-6D and EQ-5D scores correlated with each other (r = 0.41; n = 645) and with condition-specific instruments. Correlations with the PFDI and PFIQ and their prolapse subscales were in the low to moderate range (r = 0.09–0.38), similar to other studies. Using the anchor-based method, the MID was 0.026 for SF-6D and 0.025 for EQ-5D, within the range of MIDs reported in other populations and for other conditions. These findings were supported by distribution-based estimates. Conclusion: The SF-6D and EQ-5D have good validity properties and are responsive, preference-based, utility and general HRQOL measures for women undergoing surgical treatment for prolapse. The MIDs for SF-6D and EQ-5D are similar and within the range found for other medical conditions.},

For meaningful comparisons across groups, it is important to identify items on such scales that exhibit differential item functioning (DIF). In this study, the authors examined several methods for assessing DIF on polytomous items generated by an ideal point process. Two paradigms (i.e., null hypothesis significance testing [NHST] and effect size quantification) were utilized, and three test statistics (i.e., the log-likelihood ratio [LR], the Akaike information criterion [AIC], and Lord's chi-square) and two approaches to DIF testing (i.e., the constrained and free baseline methods) were evaluated. In addition, the authors investigated three levels of impact. The results revealed that DIF effect sizes were moderately large for the.50 uniform DIF conditions and small for nonuniform DIF; moreover, the LR test in general yielded the best results. When there was small to moderate impact, the free baseline approach combined with an item linking implementation produced the most satisfactory results. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Using a 2-index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)-based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, Mc- Donald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML-based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true-population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small. © 1999, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.},

   abstract = {Uniform differential item functioning (DIF) exists when the statistical relationship between item response and group is constant for all levels of a matching variable. Two other types of DIF are defined based on differences in item response functions (IRFs) among the groups of examinees: unidirectional DIF (the IRFs do not cross) and parallel DIF (the IRFs are the same shape but shifted from one another by a constant, i.e., the IRFs differ only in location). It is shown that these three types of DIF are not equivalent and the relationships among them are examined in this paper for two item response categories, two groups, and an ideal continuous univariate matching variable. The results imply that unidirectional and parallel DIF which have been considered uniform DIF by several authors are not uniform DIF. For example, it is shown in this paper that parallel three-parameter logistic IRFs do not result in uniform DIF. It is suggested that the term "uniform DIF" be reserved for the condition in which the association between the item response and group is constant for all values of the matching variable, as distinguished from parallel and unidirec-tional DIF.},

   abstract = {Detection of differential item functioning (DIF) by use of the logistic modeling approach has a long tradition. One big advantage of the approach is that it can be used to investigate nonuniform (NUDIF) as well as uniform DIF (UDIF). The classical approach allows one to detect DIF by distinguishing between multiple groups. We propose an alternative method that is a combination of recursive partitioning methods (or trees) and logistic regression methodology to detect UDIF and NUDIF in a nonparametric way. The output of the method are trees that visualize in a simple way the structure of DIF in an item showing which variables are interacting in which way when generating DIF. In addition, we consider a logistic regression method, in which DIF can be induced by a vector of covariates, which may include categorical but also continuous covariates. The methods are investigated in simulation studies and illustrated by two applications.},

   abstract = {Background: Joint replacement, an increasingly common procedure amongst older adults, can substantially improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, differential item functioning (DIF) may affect the accurate interpretation of differences in HRQoL amongst patients with different demographic and health status characteristics but the same underlying (i.e., latent) level of the investigated construct. This study tested for DIF in pre-operative SF-12 physical health (PH) and mental health (MH) sub-scale items amongst patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods: Data were from a population-based joint replacement registry from the Canadian province of Manitoba. TKA and THA patients who had surgery between 2009 and 2015 and completed a pre-operative assessment were included. DIF was tested using the multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) method with sex, age group, body weight status, and presence of multiple comorbid conditions (i.e., multimorbidity) as covariates. Analyses were stratified by joint type. Results: The study cohort included 8820 patients; 42.1% underwent THA, 57.3% were female, 32.7% were 70+ years, and 52.8% were obese. For each sub-scale, four of the six items exhibited DIF in both THA and TKA groups. Differences in the covariate effect estimates for DIF and No-DIF models on the MH latent variable were largest for age and body weight status for the THA group, and for sex and multimorbidity for the TKA group. All of the differences were small for PH. Multimorbidity had the strongest association with PH and age and sex had the strongest association with MH in the DIF models. Conclusions: Demographic and health status characteristics influenced SF-12 PH and MH item responses in joint replacement populations, although the size of the effects were not large for PH. We recommend testing and adjusting for DIF effects to ensure comparability of HRQoL measures in joint replacement populations.},

In the current study, we investigated the measurement equivalence of the GDS-15 to provide evidence that the test is a fair screening tool when administered to young-old, old-old, and oldest-old men and women. Item Response Theory-based Differential Item Functioning analyses were applied on a large sample of Italian old people. One item exhibited Differential Item Functioning when comparing men and women, and one item showed Differential Item Functioning across different age-groups. Nonetheless, the magnitude of Differential Item Functioning was small and did not produce any differential test functioning. The gender and age measurement equivalence of the GDS-15 confirms that the test can be used for clinical and research screening purposes.},

Differential item functioning across gender was restricted to two criteria and had little impact on the latent ASPD trait level. Patients fulfilling both the adult ASPD criteria and the conduct disorder criteria had similar latent trait distributions as patients fulfilling only the adult ASPD criteria. Overall, the ASPD items fit the purpose of a diagnostic instrument well, that is, distinguishing patients with moderate from those with high antisocial personality scores.},

   abstract = {Wald-type tests are a common procedure for DIF detection among the IRT-based methods. However, the empirical type I error rate of these tests departs from the significance level. In this paper, two reasons that explain this discrepancy will be discussed and a new procedure will be proposed. The first reason is related to the equating coefficients used to convert the item parameters to a common scale, as they are treated as known constants whereas they are estimated. The second reason is related to the parameterization used to estimate the item parameters, which is different from the usual IRT parameterization. Since the item parameters in the usual IRT parameterization are obtained in a second step, the corresponding covariance matrix is approximated using the delta method. The proposal of this article is to account for the estimation of the equating coefficients treating them as random variables and to use the untransformed (i.e. not reparameterized) item parameters in the computation of the test statistic. A simulation study is presented to compare the performance of this new proposal with the currently used procedure. Results show that the new proposal gives type I error rates closer to the significance level.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Male sexual dysfunction is an increasing problem across a variety of general and clinical populations, such as cancer populations; especially among prostate cancer patients who tend to receive treatments that often result in erectile dysfunction (ED) and/or premature ejaculation (PE). Therefore, in order to diagnose ED and PE in these populations, adequate and efficient instruments such as the International Index of Erectile Function 5-item version (IIEF-5) and the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) are needed. However, since this is an important topic additional evidence of psychometric properties of the IIEF-5 and the PEDT in such samples are required. Thus the aim of the present study was to use Rasch models to investigate the construct validity, local dependency, score order, and differential item functioning (DIF) of both questionnaires in a sample of prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Prostate cancer patients (n = 1058, mean±SD age = 64.07±6.84 years) who visited urology clinics were invited to fill out the IIEF-5 and the PEDT. Construct validity was examined using infit and outfit mean square (MnSq) and local dependency using correlations between each two residual Rasch scores. Score order was investigated using step and average measures of difficulty and DIF using DIF contrast. RESULTS: All IIEF-5 and PEDT items had acceptable infit and outfit MnSq. Step measures revealed that all but two items had disordered categories in terms of scores 1 to 3. Only one local dependency was found, and no items displayed DIF across age, educational level, and help seeking. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that both the IIEF-5 and the PEDT had sound psychometric properties in the Rasch analyses, although some score disordering could be detected in both instruments. The results of no DIF items in both instruments suggest using them to compare ED and PE across age and educational level is adequate.},

   abstract = {Objectives To determine whether differential item functioning (DIF) was present in the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) used in cancer (non–small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer). Methods The Partial Credit Model was applied to the three-level version of the EQ-5D with data obtained from four randomized controlled trials in prostate cancer and non–small cell lung cancer completed at baseline before treatment (N = 2213). DIF was assessed across cancer type (two levels), sex (two levels), and age group (three levels) using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square statistics and evaluated against the Educational Testing Service classification rules. Results The presence of DIF was determined in 14 of 25 (56%) potential DIF contrasts in all the EQ-5D domains. Although mostly the DIF was categorized as either negligible (3 of 25 [12%]) or medium (7 of 25 [28%]), large DIF was observed in 4 of the 25 contrasts (16%). The mobility domain, in particular, showed consistently large DIF across cancer type, sex, and age. Conclusions Given the use of the instrument in health status assessments across conditions and interventions, these results may have significant implications for the EQ-5D in health economic evaluations. Further research is warranted to determine whether these results hold for other cancers.},

   abstract = {Previous research has suggested that, when compared to European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) are at higher risk of metastatic disease at time of cancer diagnosis, and a higher risk of shorter survival. Although AA patients have reported worse physical health than EA patients, studies have rarely addressed whether racial/ethnic disparities exist on the social, emotional, and functional aspects of health-related quality of life. Five hundred and two AA and 396 EA patients with AIDS-related malignancies or breast, colon, head/neck, and lung cancers seeking treatment within the contiguous United States and Puerto Rico participated in the present study. Responses on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General were analyzed for possible racial/ethnic disparities using multivariable regression models and item response theory modeling to detect differential item functioning. Differential item functioning was found in six items of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, indicating that AA and EA participants had different probabilities of responding to these items. Compared to EAs at the same level of health-related quality of life, AAs reported more severe symptomatology on items that reflected malaise and ability to work, and less severe symptomatology on items that reflected fatigue, treatment side effects, and outlook on life. At the subscale level, AAs reported poorer physical and social well-being, but better emotional well-being, than EAs. Similar to previous studies, AA patients reported poorer physical functioning than a comparable group of EA patients. Some items appear to be responded to differently by AAs and EAs, suggesting it is important to consider race/ethnicity when evaluating responses to questions about health-related quality of life. © 2008 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.},

Objective: The main aim of this study was to provide evidence of the broad employability of the NEQ with patients of different gender and age with cancer in different phases of the disease and care process, using an Item Response Theory (IRT) approach and investigating Differential Item Functioning (DIF). Methods: The NEQ was completed by 762 patients visiting, consecutively, outpatient clinics or admitted to oncology wards. Patients included in the study had different primary tumor sites and were in different phases of the disease and care process. The properties of the questionnaire were analyzed by applying IRT to test how well each item of the scale concurs in measuring unmet needs, how reliable the whole scale is, and whether the scale was metrically invariant across gender, age, and phase of the disease. Results: Results showed that the NEQ performed well in measuring unmet needs and measurement equivalence of the scale across gender, age, and phase of the disease was verified. Conclusions: The current study supports the utility and broad employability of the NEQ, thus providing empirical evidence that it is psychometrically sound and metrically equivalent across different groups of cancer patients. As such, the scale could be an effective tool when planning psychosocial interventions to improve the care process and patients’ quality of life.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: There are few valid data that describe the extent of multimorbidity in primary care patients. The purpose of this study was to estimate its prevalence in family practice patients by counting the number of chronic medical conditions and using a measure that considers the severity of these conditions, the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS). METHODS: The study was carried out in the Saguenay region (Québec, Canada) in 2003. The participation of adult patients from 21 family physicians was solicited during consecutive consultation periods: A research nurse reviewed medical records and extracted the data regarding chronic illnesses. For each chronic condition, a severity rating was determined in accordance with the CIRS scoring guidelines. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 320 men and 660 women. Overall, 9 of 10 patients had more than 1 chronic condition. The prevalence of having 2 or more medical conditions in the 18- to 44-year, 45- to 64-year, and 65-year and older age-groups was, respectively, 68%, 95%, and 99% among women and 72%, 89%, and 97% among men. The mean number of conditions and mean CIRS score also increased significantly with age. CONCLUSIONS: Whether measured by simply counting the number of conditions or using the CIRS, the prevalence of multimorbidity is quite high and increases significantly with age in both men and women. Patients with multimorbidity seen in family practice represent the rule rather than the exception.},

   abstract = {Background: The BREAST-Q is a new patient-reported outcome instrument for cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery. For it to be used appropriately in clinical research, it is important that its validity is demonstrated. The aim of this study was to test this property. Methods: The authors evaluated the BREAST-Q subscales by using Rasch measurement methods and traditional psychometric methods with a focus on construct validity (including comparisons with existing breast-related, patient-reported outcome measures) and clinical validity (including hypothesis-driven questions with clinical subsamples). Results: A total of 817 women returned completed questionnaires (corrected response rate, 66 percent). Validity was supported by three Rasch analysis findings: the number of item response options was found to be appropriate (thresholds were ordered correctly); item locations in each subscale were spread out (range of logit span, 0.7 to 6.6), indicating that each subscale captures a wide range of issues; and fit to the Rasch model was good. Overall, scale reliability was supported by high Person separation indices (≥0.73). Traditional psychometric scale validity was supported by interscale correlations, comparisons of scores generated from clinically defined subgroups, and correlations with sociodemographic variables. Scale reliability was supported by high Cronbach's alpha coefficients (>0.80), item-total correlations (range of means, 0.58 to 0.87), and intraclass correlation coefficients (>0.80). Conclusions: This study further supports the BREAST-Q as a useful tool to study the impact and effectiveness of breast surgery from the patients' perspective. It can be used as the initial building blocks toward establishing the clinical meaning of BREAST-Q scale scores, further supporting an evidence-based approach to surgical practice.

   abstract = {Logistic regression provides a exible framework for detecting various types of differential item functioning (DIF). Previous efforts extended the framework by using item response theory (IRT) based trait scores, and by employing an iterative process using group-specific item parameters to account for DIF in the trait scores, analogous to purification approaches used in other DIF detection frameworks. The current investigation advances the technique by developing a computational platform integrating both statistical and IRT procedures into a single program. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation approach was incorporated to derive empirical criteria for various DIF statistics and effect size measures. For purposes of illustration, the procedure was applied to data from a questionnaire of anxiety symptoms for detecting DIF associated with age from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System.},

   abstract = {Objective: We assessed differential item functioning (DIF) in the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) to evaluate bias risk from the duration of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and duration of dyskinesia. Background: Assessing DIF is a core validation step for rating scales. If DIF is present for an item, interpretation must consider influences from the tested covariates. DIF can be uniform or non-uniform, depending on the consistency of influence from the given covariate across all levels of dyskinesia. Methods: Using a large UDysRS database (N = 2313), uniform and non-uniform DIF related to the duration of PD and/duration of dyskinesia were tested. Unidimensionality of UDysRS was first confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis. DIF analysis was conducted using two independent latent models. DIF in an item was confirmed if both methods independently identified DIF at a significance level using Bonferroni correction. McFadden pseudo R^2 measured clinical relevancy of DIF magnitude (negligible, moderate, and large) for items identified with DIF, and items with DIF were considered clinically relevant if they exceeded a negligible designation. Results: Most items did not show uniform or non-uniform DIF based on PD and dyskinesia duration in isolation or in combination. For all items where DIF was identified, the magnitude statistic was in the negligible range (McFadden pseudo R^2 < 0.035) and the combined impact of multiple identified DIF items on UDysRS likewise did not exceed the negligible designation. Conclusion: The absence of clinically relevant DIF suggests that the UDysRS can be applied across all patients regardless of their PD- or dyskinesia-duration.},

   abstract = {Objective: To evaluate whether items of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) function differently in persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) than in persons from a primary care sample. Design: This study was a retrospective analysis of responses to the PHQ-9 collected in 2 previous studies. Responses to the PHQ-9 were modeled using item response theory, and the presence of DIF was evaluated using ordinal logistic regression. Setting: Eight primary care sites and a single trauma center in Washington state. Participants: Participants (N=3365) were persons from 8 primary care sites (n=3000) and a consecutive sample of persons with complicated mild to severe TBI from a trauma center who were 1 year postinjury (n=365). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: PHQ-9. Results: No PHQ-9 item demonstrated statistically significant or meaningful DIF attributable to TBI. A sensitivity analysis failed to show that the cumulative effects of nonsignificant DIF resulted in a systematic inflation of PHQ-9 total scores. Therefore, the results also do not support the hypothesis that cumulative DIF for PHQ-9 items spuriously inflates the numbers of persons with TBI screened as potentially having major depressive disorder. Conclusions: The PHQ-9 is a valid screener of major depressive disorder in people with complicated mild to severe TBI, and all symptoms can be counted toward the diagnosis of major depressive disorder without special concern about overdiagnosis or unnecessary treatment. © 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

The recombinant vaccine was approved recently (October 2017), whereas the live vaccine has been available since 2008. Clinical trials have shown that the recombinant vaccine is highly effective against herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia for adults aged 50 years or older (vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster 96.6% for those 50-59 yr and 97.9% for those > 70 yr) with no evidence of waning protection after 4 years. 14 Recent immunogenicity data also suggest that the immune response is maintained up to 9 years after vaccination. 15 Conversely, clinical trials and observational data have suggested that the efficacy of the live vaccine against herpes zoster decreases with older age at vaccination (from 65.5% for those 60-69 yr to 55.4% for those ≥ 70 yr 10) and wanes with increasing time since vaccination. 16-18 Although the recombinant vaccine appears to be more effective , particularly among older adults, a 2-dose schedule is recommended , compared with a 1-dose schedule for the live vaccine; this difference has implications for costs and vaccination logistics.

   abstract = {The epidemiology of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) was quantified from a variety of data sources and the potential cost-effectiveness of vaccination assessed. The annual incidence and severity of zoster increases sharply with age, as measured by physician consultation and hospitalisation rates, average length of stay, average proportion of cases developing PHN and the age-specific case-fatality ratio. Combining these data with information on health related quality of life results in an estimated loss of 20000 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) annually in England and Wales from herpes zoster (17400 due to PHN). The current cost of treating herpes zoster associated disease is estimated to be £47.6m annually. Since both the health and economic burden are high, vaccination of the elderly is expected to be cost-effective under most scenarios, the attractiveness of immunisation increasing with age due to the increased burden of disease in the very elderly.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Widespread implementation of health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) measurement in prostate cancer practice and research requires concise instruments. With 50 questions, the full-length Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is cumbersome to administer outside of studies focusing exclusively on HRQOL. To facilitate HRQOL measurement in a broad range of prostate cancer research and practice settings, we developed and validated an abbreviated version of the EPIC. Methods: The 50 questions that constitute the full-length EPIC-50 were evaluated to identify the items suitable for elimination while retaining the ability to measure the 5 prostate cancer-specific HRQOL domains of the EPIC-50. The resulting abbreviated version (EPIC-26) was validated using question responses from 252 subjects who had undergone brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, or prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The EPIC-26 internal consistency was measured by Cronbach's α coefficient and reliability using testretest correlation. Results: Using the high itemscale correlations, clinically relevant content, and preservation of domain psychometrics, 26 items were retained in the EPIC-26 from the 50 questions in the full-length EPIC-50. A high correlation was observed between the EPIC-50 and EPIC-26 versions for the urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual, and vitality/hormonal domain scores (all r <0.96). The correlations between the different domains were low, confirming that EPIC-26 retained the ability to discern the 5 distinct HRQOL domains. The internal consistency and testretest reliability for EPIC-26 (Cronbach's α <0.70 and r <0.69, respectively for all 5 HRQOL domains) supported its validity. Conclusions: EPIC-26 is a brief, valid, and reliable subjective measure of health quality among patients with prostate cancer and is suitable for measuring the HRQOL among patients undergoing treatment of early-stage prostate cancer. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to validate the German version of the widely established Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite with 26 items (EPIC-26). Methods A German translation of the original questionnaire was tested in 3094 patients with localized or locally advanced (any T, any N and M0) prostate cancer with treatment intent (including radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, active surveillance , watchful waiting). They completed the EPIC-26 questionnaire before treatment. A total of 521 of them also completed a questionnaire 12 months afterward. Internal consistency, sensitivity to change, and construct validity were assessed. Results The internal consistency of all domains was sufficient (Cronbach's alpha between 0.64 and 0.93). Item-to-scale correlation coefficients showed acceptable associations between items and their domain score (all > 0.30), with the lowest scores for "bloody stools" (r = 0.37) and "breast problems" (r = 0.32). Confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis confirmed the five-dimension structure of the EPIC-26 (comparative fit index 0.95).

   abstract = {Background: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have become widely adopted in the care of patients with prostate cancer, but there is no validated crosswalk between two commonly used instruments, the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) instrument, which consists of the International Index of Erectile Function-6 (IIEF-6) questionnaire and the MSK radical prostatectomy urinary outcome scale. Objective: To develop and validate bidirectional crosswalks between the sexual and urinary domains (single domain in MSK, separate incontinence and irritative/obstructive domains in EPIC-26) of the MSK and EPIC-26 instruments. Design, setting, and participants: Radical prostatectomy (RP) patients completing instruments at MSK and Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) between January and May of 2017 were invited to enroll. Stratified random sampling (by institution, MSK urinary function score, and MSK erectile function score) was used to divide patient data into training and test sets. Models were developed to predict the domain score for each instrument using the other's item responses and domain scores. Performance was evaluated using capped root-mean-squared error and accuracy at established thresholds. Results and limitations: We received 517 instruments at MSK and 1033 within MUSIC, which were assigned to training (825), post-RP test (412), and pre-RP test (313) sets. We found the crosswalks to have low error and high accuracy. Although the crosswalks are more accurate if responses to each item are known, it is possible to convert between instruments on the basis of a total domain score. Conclusions: The crosswalks are a valid way to convert between sexual and urinary domains of the MSK and EPIC-26 instruments. Patient summary: We developed and validated a set of formulas that allow conversion of sexual and urinary function scores between the Memorial Sloan Kettering and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form patient-reported outcome questionnaires. These crosswalks allow seamless transition between the two questionnaires.},

Methods: Two hundred fifty-one participants completed a battery of self-report scales, including the French-Canadian version of the EPIC, after having received radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Results: The internal consistency for the urinary incontinence, bowel, and sexual domains of the EPIC-26 was high (Cronbach's alpha coefficients from 0.80?0.92), while coefficients for the urinary irritation/obstruction (0.59) and hormonal (0.67) domains were lower. Item-Total correlations (rs=0.15?0.85), and temporal stability (rs=0.72?0.93) generally supported the reliability of the instrument. The five-factor structure of the EPIC-26 was confirmed for the most part. The construct validity of the instrument was also supported by high correlations obtained between each domain and measures assessing similar constructs (rs=-0.56?0.83). The EPIC also showed an excellent sensitivity to change with significant differences obtained on EPIC scores (all p<0.05) between pre-And post-prostate cancer treatment. Conclusions: The psychometric qualities of the French-Canadian version of the EPIC are well-supported, thus providing a valid tool to assess health-related quality of life in prostate cancer patients.},

This study examined the validity and reliability of Chinese versions of the 26-item EPIC and of the 16-item EPIC for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) in Chinese patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods A Chinese version of the 26-item EPIC and the 16-item EPIC-CP were self-completed by 252 Chinese patients with prostate cancer who were recruited from three community-based cancer service centers. Confirmatory factors analysis assessed the factor structures of the EPIC and the EPIC-CP. Internal consistency and construct and clinical validities of the factor structures were assessed. Results Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the original factor structure of both EPIC-26 and EPIC-CP showed good fit to this sample. A correlated model was superior to a hierarchical model in both EPIC-26 and EPIC-CP supporting the utility of the domain scores over the total scores. Cronbach α ranged from 0.55 to 0.91 for EPIC-26 and 0.44 to 0.67 for EPIC-CP. Construct validity was supported by correlations between EPIC-26/EPIC-CP and psychological distress measures. Clinical validity was supported by differentiation between patients with and without prostatectomy. Conclusions These Chinese versions of the five-factor EPIC-26 and the EPIC-CP are valid and practical measures for assessing a range of health-related quality-of-life issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, highlighting their utility in assessing health-related quality of life for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.},

   abstract = {Background: This study aims to validate and evaluate the psychometric properties and reliability of the Italian version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite - Short Form (EPIC-26), a measure of quality of life (QoL) for prostate cancer patients. Methods: Two hundred and eighty-four prostate cancer patients completed the Italian version of the EPIC-26 questionnaire at 45 days (T1) and 3 months (T2) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Psychometric properties were evaluated using structural equation modeling: the goodness of fit of the correlated five-factor model (CFFM) for the EPIC-26 was assessed using the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), while longitudinal invariance was conducted to assess the ability of the EPIC-26 to measure QoL construct over time. Test-retest reliability was assessed as well by considering intraclass correlations. Results: At T1, the CFFM model displayed a good fit to data. Similarly, the model showed an adequate fit also at T2. Results of the reliability analysis attested the acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability of each dimension: all Cronbach's alphas could be classified as acceptable (i.e., above.65) except for low Cronbach's alpha for hormonal dysfunction at T1 (i.e.,.638) and urinary irritation at both waves. (i.e., respectively.585 and.518). Finally, psychometric properties were invariant over time and each of the five dimensions of QoL displayed from moderate (all ICCs above.500) to good test-retest reliability (i.e. ICC for urinary incontinence =.764). Conclusions: Results of the CFA and the measurement invariance analysis demonstrated the validity of the Italian version of the EPIC-26 to assess QoL in prostate cancer patients.

   abstract = {Background We report the long-term results of a trial of immediate postoperative irradiation versus a wait-and-see policy in patients with prostate cancer extending beyond the prostate, to confi rm whether previously reported progression-free survival was sustained. Methods This randomised, phase 3, controlled trial recruited patients aged 75 years or younger with untreated cT0-3 prostate cancer (WHO performance status 0 or 1) from 37 institutions across Europe. Eligible patients were randomly assigned centrally (1:1) to postoperative irradiation (60 Gy of conventional irradiation to the surgical bed for 6 weeks) or to a wait-and-see policy until biochemical progression (increase in prostate-specifi c antigen >0.2 μg/L confi rmed twice at least 2 weeks apart). We analysed the primary endpoint, biochemical progression-free survival, by intention to treat (two-sided test for diff erence at α=0.05, adjusted for one interim analysis) and did exploratory analyses of heterogeneity of eff ect. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00002511. Findings 1005 patients were randomly assigned to a wait-and-see policy (n=503) or postoperative irradiation (n=502) and were followed up for a median of 10·6 years (range 2 months to 16·6 years). Postoperative irradiation signifi cantly improved biochemical progression-free survival compared with the wait-and-see policy (198 [39·4%] of 502 patients in postoperative irradiation group vs 311 [61·8%] of 503 patients in wait-and-see group had biochemical or clinical progression or died; HR 0·49 [95% CI 0·41-0·59]; p<0·0001). Late adverse eff ects (any type of any grade) were more frequent in the postoperative irradiation group than in the wait-and-see group (10 year cumulative incidence 70·8% [66·6-75·0] vs 59·7% [55·3-64·1]; p=0.001). Interpretation Results at median follow-up of 10·6 years show that conventional postoperative irradiation signifi cantly improves biochemical progression-free survival and local control compared with a wait-and-see policy, supporting results at 5 year follow-up; however, improvements in clinical progression-free survival were not maintained. Exploratory analyses suggest that postoperative irradiation might improve clinical progression-free survival in patients younger than 70 years and in those with positive surgical margins, but could have a detrimental eff ect in patients aged 70 years or older.},

   abstract = {Objectives: In patients with prostate cancer, evaluation of quality of care requires the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes measures assessed by validated and reliable instruments. Basic psychometric tests of the Norwegian version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite with 26 items (EPIC-26) were performed in this study. Material and methods: Translation of the original questionnaire (University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index Composite), field testing and retranslation were done according to published guidelines. The final EPIC-26 items were subsequently selected from the Norwegian version of the EPIC-50 with slight verbal adjustments to comply with the English version of the EPIC-26. Reliability and validity were tested among 471 patients who, between 2009 and 2010, had been included in a prospective Norwegian multicenter study assessing adverse effects after radical prostatectomy or prostatic radiotherapy, usually combined with (neo)adjuvant hormone treatment. All patients completed the EPIC-26 before treatment and 3 and 12 months afterwards. Results: Internal consistency was documented by Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from 0.64 to 0.91 for the five domains/subdomains. Item-to-scale correlation coefficients ranged from 0.20 to 0.88, with the lowest value (0.20) for overall sexual problem. Criterion validity was proven by significant correlations between individual responses to the International Prostate Symptom Score and sum scores of the irritative/ obstructive subdomain score of the EPIC-26. Satisfactory sensitivity and responsiveness reflected clinical utility for assessing between-group differences and treatment-related changes. Conclusions: Based on basic psychometric tests, the Norwegian version of the EPIC-26 showed acceptable reliability and validity for assessment of adverse effects after treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer.

Previous efforts extended the framework by using item response theory (IRT) based trait scores, and by employing an iterative process using group-specific item parameters to account for DIF in the trait scores, analogous to purification approaches used in other DIF detection frameworks. The current investigation advances the technique by developing a computational platform integrating both statistical and IRT procedures into a single program. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation approach was incorporated to derive empirical criteria for various DIF statistics and effect size measures. For purposes of illustration, the procedure was applied to data from a questionnaire of anxiety symptoms for detecting DIF associated with age from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System.},

This study evaluated the psychometric properties of Spanish language pedsFACIT-PCF and the measurement equivalence between Spanish and English versions. Methods: pedsFACIT-PCF items were translated into Spanish using a standard iterative methodology. A total of 1358 English- and 604 Spanish-speaking children aged 8–17 years who completed English and Spanish versions of pedsFACIT-PCF, respectively, were administered through an Internet survey company. Unidimensionality was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Item responses were modeled using item response theory. The presence and impact of differential item functioning (DIF) were evaluated using ordinal logistic regression. Results: Unidimensionality of the pedsFACIT-PCF was supported. One of the 13 items demonstrated statistically significant DIF by language; however, impacts of language DIF on both individual scores and at the test level were negligible. No Spanish items showed DIF with respect to age and gender. Conclusions: The 13-item pedsFACIT-PCF demonstrated stable measurement properties on language, gender and age and can be used for future trials.},

   abstract = {Objectives. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an increasingly important endpoint in prostate cancer care. However, pivotal issues that are not fully assessed in existing HRQOL instruments include irritative urinary symptoms, hormonal symptoms, and multi-item scores quantifying bother between urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal domains. We sought to develop a novel instrument to facilitate more comprehensive assessment of prostate cancer-related HRQOL. Methods. Instrument development was based on advice from an expert panel and prostate cancer patients, which led to expanding the 20-item University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) to the 50-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC). Summary and subscale scores were derived by content and factor analyses. Reliability and validity were assessed by test-retest correlation, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, interscale correlation, and EPIC correlation with other validated instruments. Results. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were high for EPIC urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domain summary scores (each r ≥0.80 and Cronbach's alpha ≥0.82) and for most domain-specific subscales. Correlations between function and bother subscales within domains were high (r >0.60). Correlations between different primary domains were consistently lower, indicating that these domains assess distinct HRQOL components. EPIC domains had weak to modest correlations with the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), indicating rationale for their concurrent use. Moderate agreement was observed between EPIC domains relevant to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate module (FACT-P) and the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), providing criterion validity without excessive overlap. Conclusions. EPIC is a robust prostate cancer HRQOL instrument that complements prior instruments by measuring a broad spectrum of urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal symptoms, thereby providing a unique tool for comprehensive assessment of HRQOL issues important in contemporary prostate cancer management.

   abstract = {Background: Patient-reported outcome measures developed using Classical Test Theory are commonly comprised of ordinal level items on a Likert response scale are problematic as they do not permit the results to be compared between patients. Rasch analysis provides a solution to overcome this by evaluating the measurement characteristics of the rating scales using probability estimates. This is typically achieved using commercial software dedicated to Rasch analysis however, it is possible to conduct this analysis using non-specific open source software such a R. Methods: Rasch analysis was conducted using the most commonly used commercial software package, RUMM 2030, and R, using four open-source packages, with a common data set (6-month post-injury PRWE Questionnaire responses) to evaluate the statistical results for consistency. The analysis plan followed recommendations used in a similar study supported by the software package's instructions in order to obtain category thresholds, item and person fit statistics, measures of reliability and evaluate the data for construct validity, differential item functioning, local dependency and unidimensionality of the items. Results: There was substantial agreement between RUMM2030 and R with regards for most of the results, however there are some small discrepancies between the output of the two programs. Conclusions: While the differences in output between RUMM2030 and R can easily be explained by comparing the underlying statistical approaches taken by each program, there is disagreement on critical statistical decisions made by each program. This disagreement however should not be an issue as Rasch analysis requires users to apply their own subjective analysis. While researchers might expect that Rasch performed on a large sample would be a stable, two authors who complete Rasch analysis of the PRWE found somewhat dissimilar findings. So, while some variations in results may be due to samples, this paper adds that some variation in findings may be software dependent.},

The pandemic arrived unexpectedly in the fall of 1918 and had largely subsided by January 1919, generating sharp predictions for long-term effects. Data from the 1960-80 decennial U.S. Census indicate that cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher transfer payments compared with other birth cohorts.

Methods We carried out systematic literature reviews in the PubMed database to identify manuscripts which contained information regarding either the development process or metric properties of prostate cancer-specific quality of life instruments. Each instrument was evaluated by two experts, independently, using the Evaluating Measures of Patient-Reported Outcomes (EMPRO) tool. An overall and seven attribute-specific EMPRO scores were calculated (range 0-100, worst to best): measurement model, reliability , validity, responsiveness, interpretability, burden and alternative forms. Results Eight instruments and 57 manuscripts (2-15 per instrument) were identified. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) was the best rated (overall EM-PRO score 83.1 points). Good results were also obtained by University of California Los Angeles-Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI), Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale (PORPUS) and Prostate Cancer Quality of Life Instrument (PC-QoL) with 77.3, 70.5 and 64.8 points, respectively. These four instruments passed with distinction the validity and responsiveness evaluation. Insufficient reliability results were observed for UCLA-PCI and PORPUS. Conclusions Current evidence supports the choice of EPIC, PORPUS or PC-QoL. Attribute-specific EMPRO results facilitate selecting the adequate instrument for every purpose. For longitudinal studies or clinical trials, where responsiveness is the priority, EPIC or PC-QoL should be considered. We recommend the PORPUS for economic evaluations because it allows cost-utility analysis, and EPIC short versions to minimize administration burden.},

Results The unidimensional representation of the GMS was consistent with the data (χ 2 = 8.102; df = 4; p = .088). The scale was highly reliable as indicated by McDonald's omega of .84. The scale was significantly correlated with all psychological measures in the predicted direction except anxiety. After controlling for social support, the scale was significantly, positively correlated with functional quality of life, self-esteem, positive affect, and having meaning in life. Mattering was significantly, negatively correlated with searching for meaning. Significantly higher level of mattering was found among married participants and among women who had not obtained psychological therapy.

   abstract = {Background: Recently, the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26-item version (EPIC-26) was recommended for the assessment of adverse effects after the treatment of prostate cancer without clear reasons. This decision encouraged us to review the questionnaire development from the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) to the EPIC-16 CP with a focus on psychometric properties. We also reviewed PubMed for papers concerning such properties of the EPIC-26 since 2012 (latest review in 2011). Finally, we examined the psychometric properties of the EPIC-26 in a sample of Norwegian males treated with robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Methods: This study used three methods: (1) Comparison of the content of the UCLA-PCI, EPIC-50, EPIC-26, and EPIC-16 CP; (2) Review of EPIC-26 and EPIC-16 CP papers in PubMed from 2012 to 2016, identifying papers reporting on the psychometric properties of these questionnaires; and (3) Psychometric examination of the EPIC-26 rating in 651 Norwegian men treated with RALP at a mean of 3.2 years post-surgery. Results: The questionnaire development showed a significant increase in bother versus function items, and the EPIC-26 contains eight function and 18 bother items. Twelve papers concerning the EPIC-26 available on PubMed since 2012 support the psychometric properties of the EPIC-26. The Norwegian EPIC-26 findings supported the psychometric properties of the EPIC-26, but suggested six subdomains both by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Conclusions: In general our examinations supported the adequate psychometric properties of the EPIC-26, although the factor structure, construct and predictive validity of the instrument should be examined further.},

   abstract = {Purpose For patients with prostate cancer, validated and reliable instruments are essential for measuring patient-reported outcomes. The aim of this study was to validate the German version of the widely established Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite with 26 items (EPIC-26). Methods A German translation of the original questionnaire was tested in 3094 patients with localized or locally advanced (any T, any N and M0) prostate cancer with treatment intent (including radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, active surveillance , watchful waiting). They completed the EPIC-26 questionnaire before treatment. A total of 521 of them also completed a questionnaire 12 months afterward. Internal consistency, sensitivity to change, and construct validity were assessed. Results The internal consistency of all domains was sufficient (Cronbach's alpha between 0.64 and 0.93). Item-to-scale correlation coefficients showed acceptable associations between items and their domain score (all > 0.30), with the lowest scores for "bloody stools" (r = 0.37) and "breast problems" (r = 0.32). Confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis confirmed the five-dimension structure of the EPIC-26 (comparative fit index 0.95). Conclusions Psychometric evaluation suggests that the German version of the EPIC-26 is a well-constructed instrument for measuring patient-reported health-related symptoms in patients with prostate cancer.},

   abstract = {Background and purpose: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is being used for prostate cancer, but concerns persist about toxicity compared to other radiotherapy options. Materials and methods: We conducted a multi-institutional pooled cohort analysis of patient-reported quality of life (QOL) [EPIC-26] before and after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), brachytherapy, or SBRT for localized prostate cancer. Data were analyzed by mean domain score, minimal clinically detectable difference (MCD) in domain score, and multivariate analyses to determine factors associated with domain scores at 2-years. Results: Data were analyzed from 803 patients at baseline and 645 at 2-years. Mean declines at 2-years across all patients were À1.9, À4.8, À4.9, and À13.3 points for urinary obstructive, urinary incontinence, bowel, and sexual symptom domains, respectively, corresponding to MCD in 29%, 20%, and 28% of patients. On multivariate analysis (vs. IMRT), brachytherapy had worse urinary irritation at 2-years (À6.8 points, p < 0.0001) but no differences in other domains (p > 0.15). QOL after SBRT was similar for urinary (p > 0.5) and sexual domains (p = 0.57), but was associated with better bowel score (+6.7 points, p < 0.0002). Conclusions: QOL 2-years after brachytherapy, IMRT, or SBRT is very good and largely similar, with small differences in urinary and bowel QOL that are likely minimized by modern techniques. Ó Prostate cancer radiation treatment options, including intensity-modulated (IMRT), brachytherapy implants, and recently stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) each have relative advantages and disadvantages. All can have significant sexual, urinary, and bowel QOL impacts [1-4]. SBRT has presumed radiobiological advantages over IMRT [5]. Brachytherapy is completed in 1 day, SBRT in 1-3 weeks, and IMRT in 7-8 weeks. Single-institution SBRT trials show PSA control equivalent to IMRT or brachytherapy after short follow-up [6]. Cost-effectiveness analyses show SBRT is less expensive than IMRT [7], though brachytherapy is less expensive than both [8]. Convenience, non-invasiveness, and cost effectiveness are leading to increasing SBRT use nationally [9], though concerns about SBRT toxicity remain [10]. A recent phase I/II dose-escalation trial reported 9.8% grade 3-4 rectal toxicity at the highest dose level (50 Gy in 5 fractions) [11], and a retrospective study of Medicare claims data showed genitourinary (GU) complications and a transient GI toxicity were more common with SBRT [9]. In contrast, single-institutional studies evaluating QOL after prostate SBRT revealed transient declines in urinary QOL that resolved within 6 months after treatment while GI QOL was minimally affected, and sexual QOL appeared to decline similar to other radiotherapy modalities [12-16]. Here, we present a pooled analysis of QOL http://dx.},

Additionally, differential item functioning demonstrated that items are endorsed differently by gender. Specifically, males endorsed items suggesting proneness to boredom and impulsivity, as well as "active" characteristics of psychopathy. This suggests that males with psychopathic characteristics actively seek out individuals to harm.

The present study examines the measurement properties of the WHODAS 2.0 in patients with bipolar disorder using Mokken scaling analysis (i.e., monotone homogeneity and double monotonicity models) and the graded response model. No previous studies applying these models to this instrument were found. Methods: A sample of 291 patients with bipolar disorder (42.6% males) was tested. Results: The WHODAS 2.0 domains showed strong unidimensionality, with no items being omitted. In addition, the analysis of invariant item ordering showed that the items of each domain formed a hierarchical scale, with the exception of the ‘Life activities’ items for employed persons or students and item D4.5 ‘Sexual activities’ in the ‘Getting along’ domain. The WHODAS 2.0 domains and the whole scale also showed excellent reliability in bipolar disorder. Limitations: Although the study was limited to patients in Spain, the use of non-sample dependent procedures minimizes this limitation since the results are independent of the sample used. Conclusions: The WHODAS 2.0 contains six strong unidimensional domains that are hierarchical and reliable for detecting disability in bipolar disorder, although caution should be exercised with regard to some items.},

   abstract = {The multidimensional graded response model, an item response theory (IRT) model, can be used to improve the assessment of surveys, even when sample sizes are restricted. Typically, health-based survey development utilizes classical statistical techniques (e.g. reliability and factor analysis). In a review of four prominent journals within the field of Health Psychology, we found that IRT-based models were used in less than 10% of the studies examining scale development or assessment. However, implementing IRT-based methods can provide more details about individual survey items, which is useful when determining the final item content of surveys. An example using a quality of life survey for Cushing's syndrome (CushingQoL) highlights the main components for implementing the multidimensional graded response model. Patients with Cushing's syndrome (n = 397) completed the CushingQoL. Results from the multidimensional graded response model supported a 2-subscale scoring process for the survey. All items were deemed as worthy contributors to the survey. The graded response model can accommodate unidimensional or multidimensional scales, be used with relatively lower sample sizes, and is implemented in free software (example code provided in online Appendix). Use of this model can help to improve the quality of health-based scales being developed within the Health Sciences.},

   abstract = {Mixture models of item response theory (IRT) can be used to detect inappropriate category use. Data collected by panel surveys where attitudes and traits are typically assessed by short scales with many response categories are prone to response styles indicating inappropriate category use. However, the application of mixed IRT models to this data type can be challenging because of many threshold parameters within items. Up to now, there is very limited knowledge about the sample size required for an appropriate performance of estimation methods as well as goodness-of-fit criteria of mixed IRT models in this case. The present Monte Carlo simulation study examined these issues for two mixed IRT models [the restricted mixed generalized partial credit model (rmGPCM) and the mixed partial credit model (mPCM)]. The population parameters of the simulation study were taken from a real application to survey data which is challenging (a 5-item scale with an 11-point rating scale, and three latent classes). Additional data conditions (e.g., long tests, a reduced number of response categories, and a simple latent mixture) were included in this simulation study to improve the generalizability of the results. Under this challenging data condition, for each model, data were generated based on varying sample sizes (from 500 to 5,000 observations with a 500-step). For the additional conditions, only three sample sizes (consisting of 1,000, 2,500, and 4,500 observations) were examined. The effect of sample size on estimation problems and accuracy of parameter and standard error estimates were evaluated. Results show that the two mixed IRT models require at least 2,500 observations to provide accurate parameter and standard error estimates under the challenging data condition. The rmGPCM produces more estimation problems than the more parsimonious mPCM, mostly because of the sparse tables arising due to many response categories. These models exhibit similar trends of estimation accuracy across sample sizes. Under the additional conditions, no estimation problems are observed. Both models perform well with a smaller sample size when long tests were used or a true latent mixture includes two classes. For model selection, the AIC3 and the SABIC are the most reliable information criteria.},

However, polyto-mously scored items have been broadly used in a variety of tests for their advantages of providing more information and testing complicated abilities and skills. The purpose of this study is to discuss the item selection algorithms used in MCAT with polytomously scored items (PMCAT). Several promising item selection algorithms used in MCAT are extended to PMCAT, and two new item selection methods are proposed to improve the existing selection strategies. Two simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the extended and proposed methods. The simulation results show that most of the extended item selection methods for PMCAT are feasible and the new proposed item selection methods perform well. Combined with the security of the pool, when two dimensions are considered (Study 1), the proposed modified continuous entropy method (MCEM) is the ideal of all in that it gains the lowest item exposure rate and has a relatively high accuracy. As for high dimensions (Study 2), results show that mutual information (MUI) and MCEM keep relatively high estimation accuracy, and the item exposure rates decrease as the correlation increases.},

   abstract = {A number of models for categorical item response data have been proposed in recent years. The models appear to be quite different. However, they may usefully be organized as members of only three distinct classes, within which the models are distinguished only by assumptions and constraints on their parameters. "Difference models" are appropriate for ordered responses, "divide-by-total" models may be used for either ordered or nominal responses, and "left-side added" models are used for multiple-choice responses with guessing. The details of the taxonomy and the models are described in this paper. Key words: item response theory, test theory, logistic models. Over the past few years, a growing (and bewildering) array of models has been described and proposed for use in item response theory. In the beginning, there were only a few models, named either after their originator, as with the Rasch (1960) model, or after the mathematical function itself, as in the "normal ogive" model. But naming models after persons produces difficulties: it is sometimes a problem determining who the right person is, and some persons (e.g., Samejima) have invented so many models that unique nomenclature becomes problematic. Another difficulty arises when considering how much a model may be modified before a change of name is warranted. The "Rasch model" is a case in point: Rasch (1960) did not explicitly consider the population distribution, so now there is some disagreement about whether "equal-slope logistics" with some consideration of the population distribution is the "Rasch" model or not. Naming the models after their constituent curves is not much more convenient, because imposing constraints on the parameters of a model typically makes a new model, although it still uses the same mathematical function. The most recent wave of nomenclature employs the proposed function of the model; such models as the "rating scale model" (Andrich, 1978), the "partial credit model" (Masters, 1982), and the "multiple choice model" (Thissen & Steinberg, 1984) are examples. This is satisfactory until there get to be two "rating scale models," for instance; then modification is required. In addition, naming models in terms of their proposed function may have the effect of imposing limits regarding the appropriate use of a model by implying that they are useful only in their named context. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a taxonomy of some extant item response models, in the hope of clarifying some of the very close interrelationships among them, and suggesting new models to fill in obvious gaps in the current set. The taxonomy is presented in Figure 1 ; the reasoning behind it is the subject of the remainder of the paper.},

   abstract = {A new model, called acceleration model, is proposed in the framework of the heterogeneous case of the graded response model, based on processing functions defined for a finite or enumerable number of steps. The model is expected to be useful in cognitive assessment, as well as in more traditional areas of application of latent trait models. Criteria for evaluating models are proposed, and soundness and robustness of the acceleration model are discussed. Graded response models based on individual choice behavior are also discussed, and criticisms on model selection in terms of fitnesses of models to the data are also given. Samejima (I972) has proposed a general theoretical framework of the graded response model, in which the homogeneous case is distinguished from the heterogeneous case. The general graded response model represents a family of mathematical models which deal with ordered polychotomous categories in general. These ordered categories include: A, B, C, D and F in the evaluation of students' performance, strongly disagree, disagree, agree and strongly agree in a social attitude survey, partial credit given in accordance with the individual's degree of attainment toward the solution of a problem, to give some examples. With a rapid progress of computer technologies, today we can: (a) program a well-controlled cognitive experiment in computer software, (b) accommodate the software in a number of microcomputers, and (c) have each trained experimenter carry one of the microcomputers and collect data, conducting the cognitive experiment on individuals , as we do in a small-room experimental situation. In this way, we can easily collect data for several hundred individual subjects within a limited amount of time. This is a sample size comparable to those for a paper-and-pencil test in a college campus environment. Thus with such a set of data not only can we observe each individual's behavior intensively just as in a cognitive experiment, but also we can analyze such a rich set of data applying psychometric theories, put the results in perspective, clarify individual differences, et cetera. The present paper proposes a mathematical model, called acceleration model, in an effort to provide a mathematical model in the framework of general graded response model which is sound and useful in analyzing such intensive cognitive data as well as more traditional psychometric data.

   abstract = {Clauses and sentences rarely stand on their own in an actual discourse; rather, the relationship between them carries important information that allows the discourse to express a meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its individual parts. Rhetorical analysis seeks to uncover this coherence structure. In this article, we present CODRA-a COmplete probabilistic Discriminative framework for performing Rhetorical Analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory, which posits a tree representation of a discourse. CODRA comprises a discourse segmenter and a discourse parser. First, the discourse segmenter, which is based on a binary classifier, identifies the elementary discourse units in a given text. Then the discourse parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra-sentential parsing and the other for multi-sentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these two stages of parsing effectively. By conducting a series of empirical evaluations over two different data sets, we demonstrate that CODRA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, often by a wide margin. We also show that a reranking of the k-best parse hypotheses generated by CODRA can potentially improve the accuracy even further.},

   abstract = {The Chi-square statistic is a non-parametric (distribution free) tool designed to analyze group differences when the dependent variable is measured at a nominal level. Like all non-parametric statistics, the Chi-square is robust with respect to the distribution of the data. Specifically, it does not require equality of variances among the study groups or homoscedasticity in the data. It permits evaluation of both dichotomous independent variables, and of multiple group studies. Unlike many other non-parametric and some parametric statistics, the calculations needed to compute the Chi-square provide considerable information about how each of the groups performed in the study. This richness of detail allows the researcher to understand the results and thus to derive more detailed information from this statistic than from many others. The Chi-square is a significance statistic, and should be followed with a strength statistic. The Cramer's V is the most common strength test used to test the data when a significant Chi-square result has been obtained. Advantages of the Chi-square include its robustness with respect to distribution of the data, its ease of computation, the detailed information that can be derived from the test, its use in studies for which parametric assumptions cannot be met, and its flexibility in handling data from both two group and multiple group studies. Limitations include its sample size requirements, difficulty of interpretation when there are large numbers of categories (20 or more) in the independent or dependent variables, and tendency of the Cramer's V to produce relative low correlation measures, even for highly significant results.},

   abstract = {1. What are Weak Instruments? Consider the simplest classical homoskedastic IV model: y t = βx t + u t x t = Z t π + v t , where y t are one-dimensional, x t is n × 1, Z t is k × 1 and Eu t Z t = 0, one observes i.i.d. data \{y t , x t , Z t \}. Assume that n ≤ k. In general u t and v t are correlated, and thus, x t is an endogenous regressor. Z t is exogenous (since we assumed that Eu t Z t = 0), if it also relevant (EZ x has rank n), then it can serve as instrument and the model is identified. The usual TSLS will be β ˆ T SLS = (x P Z x) −1 x P Z y, where P Z = Z(Z Z) −1 Z. The problem of weak identification arises when moment conditions are not very informative about the parameter of interest, that is, when the rank of the matrix ∂g0(θ0) | θ=θ R ∂θ 0 = (θ 0) = EZ x is n, but at the same time it is very close to a reduced rank matrix (for example, the smallest eigenvalue of n × n matrix x Z(Z Z) −1 Z x is very close to zero). In the case of 1 instrument and 1 endogenous regressor weak identification corresponds to a weak correlation between the instrument and the regressor. To explain the essence of weak IV problem we start with a toy example of totally irrelevant instruments. Not relevant instrument. Imagine a situation when one has 1 endogenous regressor and 1 instrument which is independent of everything (totally irrelevant, π = 0). That is, the instrument is not valid and β is not identified. The question is how β ˆ T SLS behaves? This should explain what we see in Bounder, Jaeger, Baker's (1995) "random quarter of birth" exercise: β ˆ T SLS − β 0 = √ 1 Z t u t = T Z t v 1 t √ T σ 2 u σ uv Z t u t ξ t v t},

   abstract = {Objectives. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an increasingly important endpoint in prostate cancer care. However, pivotal issues that are not fully assessed in existing HRQOL instruments include irritative urinary symptoms, hormonal symptoms, and multi-item scores quantifying bother between urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal domains. We sought to develop a novel instrument to facilitate more comprehensive assessment of prostate cancer-related HRQOL. Methods. Instrument development was based on advice from an expert panel and prostate cancer patients, which led to expanding the 20-item University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) to the 50-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC). Summary and subscale scores were derived by content and factor analyses. Reliability and validity were assessed by test-retest correlation, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, interscale correlation, and EPIC correlation with other validated instruments. Results. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were high for EPIC urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domain summary scores (each r 0.80 and Cronbach's alpha 0.82) and for most domain-specific subscales. Correlations between function and bother subscales within domains were high (r 0.60). Correlations between different primary domains were consistently lower, indicating that these domains assess distinct HRQOL components. EPIC domains had weak to modest correlations with the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), indicating rationale for their concurrent use. Moderate agreement was observed between EPIC domains relevant to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate module (FACT-P) and the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), providing criterion validity without excessive overlap. Conclusions. EPIC is a robust prostate cancer HRQOL instrument that complements prior instruments by measuring a broad spectrum of urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal symptoms, thereby providing a unique tool for comprehensive assessment of HRQOL issues important in contemporary prostate cancer management. UROLOGY 56: 899-905, 2000. A s prostate cancer is increasingly diagnosed at early stages with favorable survival outcomes, the basis on which patients select primary therapy has shifted toward consideration of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). 1,2 However, no HRQOL instrument has previously been developed and validated in a setting concurrently representing each of the three most common current interventions for localized prostate cancer: radical prostatec-tomy, external beam radiation, and brachythera-py. 3,4 Moreover, neoadjuvant or adjuvant hormonal therapy is commonly used to complement these primary interventions, yet consequent HRQOL effects have not been sufficiently characterized , largely because of the absence of validated HRQOL scales for measuring androgen-deprivation symptoms and related bother. We sought to develop a new HRQOL instrument that would address these significant components of prostate cancer HRQOL, built on the context of previously established domains of urinary, bowel, and sexual function. 5-7},

   abstract = {Objectives-Widespread implementation of HRQOL measurement in prostate cancer practice and research requires concise instruments. Having 50 questions, the full-length Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is cumbersome to administer outside of studies focusing exclusively on HRQOL. To facilitate HRQOL measurement in a broad range of prostate cancer research and practice settings, we developed and validated an abbreviated version of EPIC. Methods-50 questions that comprise the full-length EPIC-50 were evaluated to identify items suitable for elimination while retaining ability to measure the 5 prostate cancer-specific HRQOL domains of EPIC-50. The resulting abbreviated version (EPIC-26) was validated using question responses from 252 subjects who had brachytherapy, external radiotherapy or prostatectomy for prostate cancer. EPIC-26 internal consistency was measured by Cronbach's alpha coefficient and reliability by test-retest correlation. Results-Based on high item-scale correlations, clinically relevant content, and preservation of domain psychometrics, 26 items were retained in EPIC-26 from 50 questions in the full length EPIC-50. High correlation was observed between EPIC-50 and EPIC-26 versions of urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, bowel, sexual and vitality/hormonal domain scores (all r ≥0.96). Correlations between different domains were low, confirming that EPIC-26 retains the ability to discern 5 distinct HRQOL domains. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability for EPIC-26 (Cronbach's alpha ≥0.70 and r ≥ 0.69, respectively for all 5 HRQOL domains) support its validity. Conclusions-EPIC-26 is a brief, valid and reliable subjective measure of health quality among prostate cancer patients and suitable for measuring HRQOL among patients undergoing treatment for early stage prostate cancer.},

   abstract = {Objective-The objective of the current study was to improve the assessment of physical function by improving the precision of assessment at the floor (extremely poor function) and at the ceiling (extremely good health) of the health continuum. Methods-Under the NIH PROMIS program, we developed new physical function floor and ceiling items to supplement the existing item bank. Using item response theory (IRT) and the standard PROMIS methodology, we developed 30 floor items and 26 ceiling items and administered them during a 12-month prospective observational study of 737 individuals at the extremes of health status. Change over time was compared across anchor instruments and across items by means of effect sizes. Using the observed changes in scores, we back-calculated sample size requirements for the new and comparison measures. Results-We studied 444 subjects with chronic illness and/or extreme age, and 293 generally fit subjects including athletes in training. IRT analyses confirmed that the new floor and ceiling items outperformed reference items (p<0.001). The estimated post-hoc sample size requirements were reduced by a factor of two to four at the floor and a factor of two at the ceiling. Conclusion-Extending the range of physical function measurement can substantially improve measurement quality, can reduce sample size requirements and improve research efficiency. The paradigm shift from Disability to Physical Function includes the entire spectrum of physical function, signals improvement in the conceptual base of outcome assessment, and may be transformative as medical goals more closely approach societal goals for health.},

   abstract = {Parse trees in NLP, analogous to those in compilers, are used to analyze the syntactic structure of sentences. There are two main types of structures used-constituency structures and dependency structures. Constituency Grammar uses phrase structure grammar to organize words into nested constituents. This will be covered in more detail in following chapters. We now focus on Dependency Parsing. Dependency structure of sentences shows which words depend on (modify or are arguments of) which other words. These binary asymmetric relations between the words are called dependencies and are depicted as arrows going from the head (or governor, superior, regent) to the dependent (or modifier, inferior, subordinate). Usually these dependencies form a tree structure. They are often typed with the name of grammatical relations (subject, prepositional object, apposition, etc.). An example of such a dependency tree is shown in Figure 1. Sometimes a fake ROOT node is added as the head to the whole tree so that every word is a dependent of exactly one node. Figure 1: Dependency tree for the sentence "Bills on ports and immigration were submitted by Senator Brownback, Republican of Kansas" 1.1 Dependency Parsing Dependency parsing is the task of analyzing the syntactic dependency structure of a given input sentence S. The output of a dependency parser is a dependency tree where the words of the input sentence are connected by typed dependency relations. Formally, the dependency parsing problem asks to create a mapping from the input sentence with words S = w 0 w 1 ...w n (where w 0 is the ROOT) to its dependency tree graph G. Many different variations of dependency-based methods have been developed in recent years, including neural network-based methods, which we will describe later. To be precise, there are two subproblems in dependency parsing (adapted from Kuebler et al., chapter 1.2): 1. Learning: Given a training set D of sentences annotated with dependency graphs, induce a parsing model M that can be used to parse new sentences.},

This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements .},

   abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks from the previous chapter: they are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural Networks still apply. So what does change? ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.},

   abstract = {Let's have a quick refresher on the word2vec algorithm. The key insight behind word2vec is that 'a word is known by the company it keeps'. Concretely, suppose we have a 'center' word c and a contextual window surrounding c. We shall refer to words that lie in this contextual window as 'outside words'. For example, in Figure 1 we see that the center word c is 'banking'. Since the context window size is 2, the outside words are 'turning', 'into', 'crises', and 'as'. The goal of the skip-gram word2vec algorithm is to accurately learn the probability distribution P (O|C). Given a specific word o and a specific word c, we want to calculate P (O = o|C = c), which is the probability that word o is an 'outside' word for c, i.e., the probability that o falls within the contextual window of c. Figure 1: The word2vec skip-gram prediction model with window size 2 In word2vec, the conditional probability distribution is given by taking vector dot-products and applying the softmax function: P (O = o | C = c) = exp(u o v c) w∈Vocab exp(u w v c) (1) Here, u o is the 'outside' vector representing outside word o, and v c is the 'center' vector representing center word c. To contain these parameters, we have two matrices, U and V. The columns of U are all the 'outside' vectors u w. The columns of V are all of the 'center' vectors v w. Both U and V contain a vector for every w ∈ Vocabulary. 1 Recall from lectures that, for a single pair of words c and o, the loss is given by: J naive-softmax (v c , o, U) = − log P (O = o|C = c). (2) Another way to view this loss is as the cross-entropy 2 between the true distribution y and the predicted distributionˆydistributionˆ distributionˆy. Here, both y andˆyandˆ andˆy are vectors with length equal to the number of words in the vocabulary. Furthermore, the k th entry in these vectors indicates the conditional probability of the k th word being an 'outside word' for the given c. The true empirical distribution y is a one-hot vector with a 1 for the true outside word o, and 0 everywhere else. The predicted distributionˆydistributionˆ distributionˆy is the probability distribution P (O|C = c) given by our model in equation (1). (a) (3 points) Show that the naive-softmax loss given in Equation (2) is the same as the cross-entropy loss between y andˆyandˆ andˆy; i.e., show that 1 Assume that every word in our vocabulary is matched to an integer number k. u k is both the k th column of U and the 'outside' word vector for the word indexed by k. v k is both the k th column of V and the 'center' word vector for the word indexed by k. In order to simplify notation we shall interchangeably use k to refer to the word and the index-of-the-word.},

Because this classifier learns and uses just a small number of dense features , it can work very fast, while achieving an about 2% improvement in unla-beled and labeled attachment scores on both English and Chinese datasets.

   abstract = {Spurred by advances in processing power, memory, storage, and an unprecedented wealth of data, computers are being asked to tackle increasingly complex learning tasks, often with astonishing success. Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games − tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome. M achine learning is the scientific discipline that focuses on how computers learn from data. 1,2 It arises at the intersection of statistics, which seeks to learn relationships from data, and computer science, with its emphasis on efficient computing algorithms. This marriage between mathematics and computer science is driven by the unique computational challenges of building statistical models from massive data sets, which can include billions or trillions of data points. The types of learning used by computers are conveniently subclassified into categories such as supervised learning and unsupervised learning. However, I find, in addition, that another division can be useful when considering how machine learning might inform the practice of medicine: distinguishing learning those tasks that physicians can already do well and learning those where physicians have had only limited success. With these broad categories in mind, we can visit some areas in medicine that have benefited or might benefit from machine learning approaches.},

Recently, such techniques have also been applied to various medical, including histopathological, images to assist the process of medical diagnosis. In some cases, deep learning-based algorithms have already outperformed experienced pathologists for recognition of histopathological images. However, pathological images differ from general images in some aspects, and thus, machine learning of histopathological images requires specialized learning methods. Moreover, many pathologists are skeptical about the ability of deep learning technology to accurately recognize histopathological images because what the learned neural network recognizes is often indecipherable to humans. In this review, we first introduce various applications incorporating machine learning developed to assist the process of pathologic diagnosis, and then describe machine learning problems related to histopathological image analysis, and review potential ways to solve these problems.},

   abstract = {Background: Data measuring airborne pollutants, public health and environmental factors are increasingly being stored and merged. These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed. Results: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology. Conclusions: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests that many more fruitful applications can be expected in the future.},

   abstract = {Background: No previous study has comprehensively reviewed the application of machine learning algorithms in mood disorders populations. Herein, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate previous studies of machine learning-devised models that predict therapeutic outcomes in mood disorders populations. Methods: We searched Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed from inception to February 8, 2018 for relevant studies that included adults with bipolar or unipolar depression; assessed therapeutic outcomes with a pharmacological, neuromodulatory, or manual-based psychotherapeutic intervention for depression; applied a machine learning algorithm; and reported predictors of therapeutic response. A random-effects meta-analysis of proportions and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Results: We identified 639 records: 75 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility; 26 studies (= n 17, 499) and 20 studies (= n 6325) were included in qualitative and quantitative review, respectively. Classification algorithms were able to predict therapeutic outcomes with an overall accuracy of 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] of [0.77, 0.87]). Pooled estimates of classification accuracy were significantly greater (p < 0.01) in models informed by multiple data types (e.g., composite of phenomenological patient features and neuroimaging or peripheral gene expression data; pooled proportion [95% CI] = 0.93[0.86, 0.97]) when compared to models with lower-dimension data types (pooledproportion to = 0.68[0.62, 0.74] 0.85[0.81, 0.88]). Limitations: Most studies were retrospective; differences in machine learning algorithms and their implementation (e.g., cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning); cannot infer importance of individual variables fed into learning algorithm. Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms provide a powerful conceptual and analytic framework capable of integrating multiple data types and sources. An integrative approach may more effectively model neurobiolo-gical components as functional modules of pathophysiology embedded within the complex, social dynamics that influence the phenomenology of mental disorders.},

   abstract = {s u m m a r y Objective: This study reports the development of the OsteoArthritis Questionnaire (OA-Quest) e a new measure designed to comprehensively capture the potentially modifiable burden of osteoarthritis. Design: Item development was guided by the a priori conceptual framework of the Personal Burden of Osteoarthritis (PBO) which captures 8 dimensions of osteoarthritis burden (Physical distress, Fatigue, Physical limitations, Psychosocial distress, Physical de-conditioning, Financial hardship, Sleep disturbances , Lost productivity). One hundred and twenty three candidate items were pretested in a clinical sample of 18 osteoarthritis patients. The measurement properties of the OA-Quest were assessed with exploratory factor analysis (EFA), Rasch modelling, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in a community-based sample (n ¼ 792). Results: EFA replicated 7 of the 8 PBO domains. An exception was PBO Fatigue domain, with items merging into the Physical distress subscale in the OA-Quest. Following item analysis, a 42-item 7-subscale questionnaire was constructed, measuring Physical distress (seven items, Cronbach's a ¼ 0.93), Physical limitations (11 items, a ¼ 0.95), Psychosocial distress (seven items, a ¼ 0.93), Physical de-conditioning (four items, a ¼ 0.87), Financial hardship (four items, a ¼ 0.93), Sleep disturbances (five items, a ¼ 0.96), and Lost productivity (four items a ¼ 0.90). A highly restricted 7-factor CFA model had excellent fit with the data (c 2 (113) ¼ 316.36, P < 0.001; chi-square/degrees of freedom ¼ 2.8; comparative fit index [CFI] ¼ 0.97; root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] ¼ 0.07), supporting construct validity of the new measure. Conclusions: The OA-Quest is a new measure of osteoarthritis burden that is founded on a comprehensive conceptual model. It has strong evidence of construct validity and provides reliable measurement across a broad range of osteoarthritis burden.},

   abstract = {Women undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer can choose between breast conserving therapy and mastectomy (with or without breast reconstruction). Patients often turn to outcomes data to help guide the decision-making process. The BREAST-Q is a validated breast surgery–specific patient-reported outcome measure that evaluates satisfaction, quality of life, and patient experience. It was originally developed for paper-and-pencil administration. However, the BREAST-Q has increasingly been administered electronically. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of an electronic version of the BREAST-Q in a large online survey. Women with a history of breast cancer surgery recruited from the Love/AVON Army of Women program completed an electronic version of the BREAST-Q in addition to the Impact of Cancer Survey and PTSD Checklist. Traditional psychometric analyses were performed on the collected data. BREAST-Q data were collected from 6748 women (3497 Breast Conserving Therapy module, 1295 Mastectomy module, 1956 Breast Reconstruction module). Acceptability was supported by a high response rate (82%), low frequency of missing data (<5%), and maximum endorsement frequencies (<80%) in all but 17 items. Scale reliability was supported by high Cronbach's α coefficients (≥0.78) and item-total correlations (range of means, 0.65–0.91). Validity was supported by interscale correlations, convergent and divergent hypotheses as well as clinical hypotheses. The electronically administered BREAST-Q yields highly reliable, clinically meaningful data for use in clinical outcomes research. The BREAST-Q can be used in the clinical setting, whether administered electronically or using paper-and-pencil, at the choice of the patient and surgeon.},

Pre-study calculation of the sample size is important; if a sample size is too small, one will not be able to detect an effect, while a sample that is too large may be a waste of time and money. Methods to calculate the sample size are explained in statistical textbooks, but because there are many different formulas available, it can be difficult for investigators to decide which method to use. Moreover, these calculations are prone to errors, because small changes in the selected parameters can lead to large differences in the sample size.

   abstract = {Celebrities frequently endorse products, brands, political candidates, or health campaigns. We investigated the effectiveness of such endorsements by meta-analyzing 46 studies published until April 2016 involving 10,357 participants. Applying multilevel meta-analysis, we analyzed celebrity endorsements in the context of for-profit and non-profit marketing. Findings revealed strong positive and negative effects when theoretically relevant moderators were included in the analysis. The most positive attitudinal effect appeared for male actors who match well with an implicitly endorsed object (d = .90). The most negative effect was found for female models not matching well with an explicitly endorsed object (d = −.96). Furthermore, celebrity endorsements performed worse compared to endorsements of quality seals, awards, or endorser brands. No publication bias was detected. The study has theoretical and practical implications, and provides an agenda for future research. Celebrity endorsements are a well-established marketing strategy used since the late nineteenth century (Erdogan 1999). While the strategy was first applied in traditional brand or product marketing (Erdogan 1999), it has spread to any form of marketing communication, including political marketing (Chou 2014, 2015), health communication, and the marketing of non-government organizations (NGOs; *Jackson 2008; *Wheeler 2009; *Young and Miller 2015). Current estimates indicate every fourth to fifth advertisement incorporates this strategy, though this varies across countries (USA: 19-25%, Elberse and Verleun 2012; Stephens and Rice 1998; UK: 21%, Pringle and Binet 2005; India: 24%, Crutchfield 2010; Japan: 70%, Kilburn 1998; Taiwan: 45%, Crutchfield 2010). In addition, longitudinal analyses show a steady increase over the past years (Erdogan 1999; Pringle and Binet 2005). Hence, many studies have been conducted to test whether consumer attitudes and behavior are changed by celebrity endorsements. So far, results have been summarized in three narrative (Bergkvist and Zhou 2016; Erdogan 1999; Kaikati 1987) and one quantitative review (Amos et al. 2008; see the Appendix for a summary of the review). The quantitative review of Amos and colleagues focused on source effects of celebrity endorsers. In short, it asked which source variables (e.g., expertise, attractiveness) exert which influence on advertising effectiveness. However, it did not test whether the obtained effect sizes were significant, but solely tested whether they were significantly different from each other. Hence, up until now, there is no meta-analytic knowledge about whether celebrity endorsements actually influence consumers' responses , including the size of their influence. In addition, there is no knowledge about whether effects differ in terms of specific outcomes (e.g., cognitive, affective, behavioral). The reason is that Amos et al. (2008) applied only a combined measure of advertising effectiveness. Furthermore, frequently claimed propositions like the match-up hypothesis or the proposition of stronger effects in the case of unfamiliar brands have never been tested on a meta-analytic level. This seems particularly pressing considering the fact that practitioners frequently refer to such claims (Erdogan 1999). Besides, there},

It does so within the analytic framework of the psychological contract, and advances theory and knowledge about the psychological contract by exploring it from a variety of perspectives. It also sets the psychological contract within the context of a range of other potential influences on work-related well-being including workload, job insecurity, employability, and organizational support. The book identifies the relative importance of these various potential influences on well-being, covering seven countries; Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK, as well as Israel as a comparator outside Europe. The book's conclusions are interesting and controversial. The central finding is that contrary to expectations, temporary workers report higher well-being than permanent workers. As expected, a range of factors help to explain variations in work-related well-being and the research highlights the important role of the psychological contract. However, even after taking into account alternative explanations, the significant influence of type of employment contract remains, with temporary workers reporting higher well-being. In addition to this core finding, by exploring several aspects of the psychological contract, and taking into account both employer and employee perspectives, the book sheds light on the nature and role of the psychological contract. It also raises some challenging policy questions and while acknowledging the potentially precarious nature of temporary jobs, highlights the need to consider the increasingly demanding nature of permanent jobs and their effects on the well-being of employees.},

Objective: To assess internal consistency (IC) and item-total correlation (ITC) of assessment tools used in the Pain, Functional Impairment, and Quality of Life study. Methods: Participants completed 5 patient-reported outcome instruments (EQ-5D-5L with visual analog scale, Brief Pain Inventory v2 Short Form [BPI], International Physical Activity Questionnaire [IPAQ], Short Form 36 Health Survey v2 [SF-36v2], and Hemophilia Activities List [HAL]) and underwent an optional physiotherapist-administered musculoskeletal exam (Hemophilia Joint Health Score v2.1) during routine visits. Reliability assessment included IC and ITC of each instrument. Results: A total of 381 adult PWH (median age, 34 years) were enrolled. Participants were predominantly white/non-Hispanic (69.2%); 75% had congenital hemophilia A, and 70.5% had severe hemophilia.

   abstract = {Background: Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) are gaining more and more importance in the context of clinical trials. The assessment of PRO is frequently performed by questionnaires where the multiple items of a questionnaire are usually pooled within summarizing scores. These scores are used as variables to measure subjective aspects of treatments and diseases. In clinical research, the calculation of these scores is mostly kept very simple, e.g. by a simple summation of item values. In the medical literature, there is hardly any guidance for performing a refinements of questionnaires and for deducing adequate scores. In contrast, in psychometric literature, there are plenty of more sophisticated methods, which overcome typical assumptions made in traditional (sum) scores, however to the prize of more complicated algorithms, which might be difficult to communicate. When faced with the practical task to refine an existing questionnaire, there exist a clear gap of guidance for applied medical researchers. By this article we try to fill this important gap between psychometric theory and medical application by illustrating our methodological choices on the example of a clinical PRO questionnaire. Methods: Based on our experiences with the refinement of the BCTOS, a PRO questionnaire to assess aesthetic and function after breast conserving therapy in breast cancer patients, we present the following general steps that we performed by refining the BCTOS questionnaire and its scores: 1. Refinement of the length of the questionnaire and the (item-factor) structure. 2. Selection of the factor score estimation method. 3. Validation of the refined questionnaire and scores with respect to validity, reliability and structure based on a validation cohort.},

The ageing of the population in most of the developed world and in Greece, challenge-nursing care, therefore, nursing education needs to be updated accordingly. Until today there have been no studies in Greece in relation to student nurses' attitudes towards older people. To have a reliable questionnaire for measuring a Greek population's attitudes towards older people the Kogan's Old People Scale was translated into Greek. Design. The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. The main reason for choosing a cross-sectional survey was the time limits for the study. A sample of 390 nursing students in Athens participated in the study. Methods. A questionnaire was given to the students, which included the Kogan's Old People Scale. Results. Results showed Cronbach's alpha coefficient 0.73 for the OP- scale and 0-65 for the OP+ scale, which are comparable to published studies until today. The six-factor solution explains the 41-5% of the variance in the sample. The scale was also found to differentiate between first and final year students on how their education in nursing is influencing their attitudes towards the older people. Conclusions. Reliability and validity supported the Greek version of the Kogan's Old People Scale as a reliable instrument. Its use in evaluating Greek nursing education programmes could help in preparing nurses capable of meeting the needs of older people. Relevance to clinical practice. Nursing education - basic and lifelong - needs to be updated in order to respond to the needs of older people and a reliable instrument can help to evaluate it. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: The primary aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically test a Greek-language instrument for measuring satisfaction with home care. The first empirical evidence about the level of satisfaction with these services in Greece is also provided. Methods: The questionnaire resulted from literature search, on-site observation and cognitive interviews. It was applied in 2006 to a sample of 201 enrollees of five home care programs in the city of Thessaloniki and contains 31 items that measure satisfaction with individual service attributes and are expressed on a 5-point Likert scale. The latter has been usually considered in practice as an interval scale, although it is in principle ordinal. We thus treated the variable as an ordinal one, but also employed the traditional approach in order to compare the findings. Our analysis was therefore based on ordinal measures such as the polychoric correlation, Kendall's Tau b coefficient and ordinal Cronbach's alpha. Exploratory factor analysis was followed by an assessment of internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, construct validity and sensitivity. Results: Analyses with ordinal and interval scale measures produced in essence very similar results and identified four multi-item scales. Three of these were found to be reliable and valid: socioeconomic change, staff skills and attitudes and service appropriateness. A fourth dimension-service planning-had lower internal consistency reliability and yet very satisfactory test-retest reliability, construct validity and floor and ceiling effects. The global satisfaction scale created was also quite reliable. Overall, participants were satisfied-yet not very satisfied-with home care services. More room for improvement seems to exist for the socioeconomic and planning aspects of care and less for staff skills and attitudes and appropriateness of provided services. Conclusions: The methods developed seem to be a promising tool for the measurement of home care satisfaction in Greece.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the translation of the IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 1) and to assess the applicability, validity, reliability and sensitivity of the instrument in both males and females with LUTS in Chinese population.Methods: The translation of the IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 1) was reviewed through back translation. Modifications were made, resulting in the development of The IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 2). The content validity was assessed by contend validity index. 233 subjects with LUTS were recruited in Hong Kong primary care settings for pilot psychometric testing. The construct validity was assessed by corrected item-total correlation and Pearson's correlation test against ICIQ-UI SF, IIQ-7 and SF-12 v2. The reliability was assessed by the internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha coefficient) and test -retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient). The Sensitivity was determined by performing known group comparisons by independent T-test.Results: The content validity index for all items could reach 1. Corrected item-total correlation scores were ≥0.4 for four symptom questions (feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, intermittency, weak stream and straining). Overall, the total symptom score moderately correlated with ICIQ-UI SF. The quality of life score moderately correlated with the IIQ-7 but weakly correlated with SF-12 v2. Overall, the reliability of the IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 2) was acceptable (Cronbach's Alpha coefficient = 0.71, ICC of the symptom questions =0.8, ICC of the quality of life question =0.7). The symptoms questions and quality of life questions of the IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese versions 2) were sensitive in detecting differences between groups.Conclusions: The IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 2) is a valid, reliable and sensitive measure to assess Chinese females and males with lower urinary tract symptoms. The IPSS quality of life question is more sensitive than the generic quality of life measure to differentiate subgroups. © 2014 Choi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {SummaryBackground Health outcomes research has gained considerable traction over the past decade as the medical community attempts to move beyond traditional outcome measures such as morbidity and mortality. Since its inception in 2009, the BREAST-Q has provided meaningful and reliable information regarding health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and patient satisfaction for use in both clinical practice and research. In this study, we review how researchers have used the BREAST-Q and how it has enhanced our understanding and practice of plastic and reconstructive breast surgery. Methods An electronic literature review was performed to identify publications that used the BREAST-Q to assess patient outcomes. Studies developing and/or validating the BREAST-Q or an alternate patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), review papers, conference abstracts, discussions, comments and/or responses to previously published papers, studies that modified a version of BREAST-Q, and studies not published in English were excluded. Results Our literature review yielded 214 unique articles, 49 of which met our inclusion criteria. Important trends and highlights were further examined. Discussion The BREAST-Q has provided important insights into breast surgery highlighted by literature concerning autologous reconstruction, implant type, fat grafting, and patient education. The BREAST-Q has increased the use of PROMs in breast surgery and provided numerous important insights in its brief existence. The increased interest in PROMs as well as the underutilized potential of the BREAST-Q should permit its continued use and ability to foster innovations and improve quality of care.},

Topics include health-state utility measures, the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), uncertainty analysis, discounting, decision tree analysis, and Markov modeling. Conclusion: Economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences. With increasing health care expenditure and limited resources, it is important for physicians to consider the economic impact of their interventions. Understanding common methodology involved in health economic evaluation will improve critical appraisal of the literature and optimize future economic evaluations.},

   abstract = {Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) aims to obtain more useful diagnostic information by taking advantages of computerized adaptive testing (CAT). Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) have been developed to classify examinees into the correct proficiency classes so as to get more efficient remediation, whereas CAT tailors optimal items to the exami-nee's mastery profile. The item selection method is the key factor of the CD-CAT procedure. In recent years, a large number of parametric/nonparametric item selection methods have been proposed. In this article, the authors proposed a series of stratified item selection methods in CD-CAT, which are combined with posterior-weighted Kullback-Leibler (PWKL), nonpara-metric item selection (NPS), and weighted nonparametric item selection (WNPS) methods, and named S-PWKL, S-NPS, and S-WNPS, respectively. Two different types of stratification indices were used: original versus novel. The performances of the proposed item selection methods were evaluated via simulation studies and compared with the PWKL, NPS, and WNPS methods without stratification. Manipulated conditions included calibration sample size, item quality, number of attributes, number of strata, and data generation models. Results indicated that the S-WNPS and S-NPS methods performed similarly, and both outperformed the S-PWKL method. And item selection methods with novel stratification indices performed slightly better than the ones with original stratification indices, and those without stratification performed the worst.},

   abstract = {Context Monitoring of health-related quality of life and symptoms of patients with brain tumors is needed yet not always feasible. This is partially due to lack of brief-yet-precise assessments with minimal administration burden that are easily incorporated into clinics. Dynamic computerized adaptive testing (CAT) or static fixed-length short forms, derived from psychometrically sound item banks, are designed to fill this void. Objective This study evaluated the comparability of scores obtained from CATs and short forms. Methods Patients (ages 7–22 years) were recruited from brain tumor clinics and completed Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System CATs and short forms (Fatigue, Mobility, Upper Extremity, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, and Peer Relationships). Pearson correlations, paired t-tests, and Cohen's d were used to evaluate the relationship, significant differences, and the magnitude of the difference between these two scores, respectively. Results Data from 161 patients with brain tumors were analyzed. Patients completed each CAT within 2 minutes. Scores obtained from CATs and short forms were highly correlated (r = 0.95–0.98). Significantly different CAT vs. short-form scores were found on 4 (of 6) domains yet with negligible effect sizes (|d| < 0.09). These relationships varied across patients with different levels of reported symptoms, with the strongest association at the worst or best symptom scores. Conclusions This study demonstrated the comparability of scores from CATs and short forms. Yet the agreement between these two varied across degrees of symptom severity which was a result of the ceiling effects of static short forms. We recommend CATs to enable individualized assessment for longitudinal monitoring.},

   abstract = {Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) greatly improves measurement efficiency in high-stakes testing operations through the selection and administration of test items with the difficulty level that is most relevant to each individual test taker. This paper explains the 3 components of a conventional CAT item selection algorithm: test content balancing, the item selection criterion, and item exposure control. Several noteworthy methodologies underlie each component. The test script method and constrained CAT method are used for test content balancing. Item selection criteria include the maximized Fisher information criterion, the b-matching method, the a-stratification method, the weighted likelihood information criterion, the efficiency balanced information criterion, and the Kullback-Leibler information criterion. The randomesque method, the Sympson-Hetter method, the unconditional and conditional multinomial methods, and the fade-away method are used for item exposure control. Several holistic approaches to CAT use automated test assembly methods, such as the shadow test approach and the weighted deviation model. Item usage and exposure count vary depending on the item selection criterion and exposure control method. Finally, other important factors to consider when determining an appropriate CAT design are the computer resources requirement, the size of item pools, and the test length. The logic of CAT is now being adopted in the field of adaptive learning, which integrates the learning aspect and the (formative) assessment aspect of education into a continuous, individualized learning experience. Therefore, the algorithms and technologies described in this review may be able to help medical health educators and high-stakes test developers to adopt CAT more actively and efficiently.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measuring patient-reported outcomes has become increasingly important in cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery. The objective of this study was to develop a new patient-reported outcome measure to assess the unique outcomes of breast surgery patients. METHODS: Patient interviews, focus groups, expert panels, and a literature review were used to develop a conceptual framework and a list of questionnaire items. Three procedure-specific questionnaires (augmentation, reduction, and reconstruction) were developed and cognitive debriefing interviews used to pilot each questionnaire. Revised questionnaires were field tested with 1950 women at five centers in the United States and Canada (response rate, 72 percent); 491 patients also completed a test-retest questionnaire. Rasch measurement methods were used to construct scales, and traditional psychometric analyses, following currently recommended procedures and criteria, were performed to allow for comparison with existing measures. RESULTS: The conceptual framework included six domains: satisfaction with breasts, overall outcome, and process of care, and psychosocial, physical, and sexual well-being. Independent scales were constructed for these domains. This new patient-reported outcome measure "system" (the BREAST-Q) contains three modules (augmentation, reconstruction, and reduction), each with a preoperative and postoperative version. Each scale fulfilled Rasch and traditional psychometric criteria (including person separation index 0.76 to 0.95; Cronbach's alpha 0.81 to 0.96; and test-retest reproducibility 0.73 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: The BREAST-Q can be used to study the impact and effectiveness of breast surgery from the patient's perspective. By quantifying satisfaction and important aspects of health-related quality of life, the BREAST-Q has the potential to support advocacy, quality metrics, and an evidence-based approach to surgical practice. ©2009American Society of Plastic Surgeons.},

   abstract = {The Maximum-likelihood estimator dominates the estimation of general structural equation models. Noniterative, equation-by-equation estimators for factor analysis have received some attention, but little has been done on such estimators for latent variable equations. I propose an alternative 2SLS estimator of the parameters in LISREL type models and contrast it with the existing ones. The new 2SLS estimator allows observed and latent variables to originate from nonnormal distributions, is consistent, has a known asymptotic covafiance matrix, and is es-timable with standard statistical software. Diagnostics for evaluating instrumental variables are described. An empirical example illustrates the estimator. Full-information estimators such as maximum likelihood (ML), generalized least square (GLS), and weighted least squares (WLS) dominate the applications of structural equation modeling (SEM). Despite this, researchers continue to show interest in limited-information, noniterative estimators. Several reasons support this interest. First, in general the ML, GLS, and WLS estimators are more computationally-intensive procedures than are the noniterative estimators. Second, SEM software packages like LISREL (Jrreskog & Sfrbom, 1993) use limited-information, noniterative estima-tors to provide starting values that can reduce the number of iterations and that can lessen the chances of nonconvergence for the iterative estimators. Aside from these computational aspects, consistent noniterative estimators have value in their own right. ML, GLS, and WLS incorporate information from throughout the system in developing estimates. This can improve estimator efficiency. A drawback is that specification error in one part of the system can spread bias to other parts of the model. Limited-information estimators tend to isolate the bias to fewer parts of the system. Nearly all the work on noniterative estimators in the SEM tradition has concentrated on the measurement model or factor analysis (Higglund, 1982; Jrreskog, 1983; Madansky, 1964). An exception is JOreskog and S0rbom (1993) who use a two-stage least squares (2SLS)/instrumental variable (IV) procedure to estimate the coefficients of the latent variable ("structural") model as well. Their estimates require that the measurement model be estimated first and they do not give the distributional properties, standard errors, or significance tests for the coefficients of the latent variable model. This paper has several purposes. First, I propose an alternative 2SLS estimator of I gratefully acknowledge support for this research from the Sociology Program of the National Science Foundation (SES-9121564) and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, Cali-fornia.},

Digital phenotyping, a paradigmatic example, refers to the use of computerized measurement tools to capture the characteristics of different psychiatric disorders. Similarly, machine learning-a form of artificial intelligence-can improve the classification of patients based on patterns that clinicians have not always considered in the past. Remote or automated interventions (web-based or smartphone-based apps), as well as virtual reality and neurofeedback, are already available or under development. Objective: These recent changes have the potential to disrupt practices, as well as practitioners' beliefs, ethics and representations, and may even call into question their professional culture. However, the impact of new technologies on health professionals' practice in addictive disorder care has yet to be determined. In the present paper, we therefore present an overview of new technology in the field of addiction medicine. Method: Using the keywords [e-health], [m-health], [computer], [mobile], [smartphone], [wearable], [digital], [machine learning], [ecological momentary assessment], [biofeedback] and [virtual reality], we searched the PubMed database for the most representative articles in the field of assessment and interventions in substance use disorders. Results: We screened 595 abstracts and analyzed 92 articles, dividing them into seven categories: e-health program and web-based interventions, machine learning, computerized adaptive testing, wearable devices and digital phenotyping, ecological momentary assessment, biofeedback, and virtual reality. Conclusion: This overview shows that new technologies can improve assessment and interventions in the field of addictive disorders. The precise role of connected devices, artificial intelligence and remote monitoring remains to be defined. If they are to be used effectively, these tools must be explained and adapted to the different profiles of physicians and patients. The involvement of patients, caregivers and other health professionals is essential to their design and assessment.},

   abstract = {Background: Technical innovations such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), machine learning (ML), computerized adaptive testing (CAT), Digital Phenotyping, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Algorithms, and Biomarkers have caused a paradigm shift in psychiatric care. The aim of the present study was to explore how student nurses view this paradigm shift, by assessing the acceptability of smartphone-based EMA, CAT, and biosensor-based Digital Phenotyping. We also investigated the factors affecting this acceptability. Method: Student nurses recruited via nursing schools participated in a quantitative study involving the screen-play method, in which they were exposed to two scenarios about depression care, one featuring EMA and CAT, the other featuring a connected wristband (CW) for Digital Phenotyping. Four acceptability domains (usefulness, usability, reliability, risk) were investigated. Results: We recorded 1216 observations for the first scenario and 1106 for the second. Regarding overall acceptability , the CW was viewed less positively than CAT and EMA. Regarding reliability, whereas respondents believed that the CW could correctly detect depressive relapse, they did not think that EMA and CAT were sufficiently reliable for the accurate diagnosis of depressive disorder. More than 70% of respondents stated that they would nevertheless be interested in offering EMA, CAT or CW to their patients, but more than 60% feared that these devices might hinder the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion: This was the first study assessing student nurses' views of EMA, CAT and CW-based digital pheno-typing. Respondents were interested in these new technologies and keen to offer them to their patients. However, our study highlighted several issues, as respondents doubted the reliability of these devices and feared that they would hinder the therapeutic relationship. Subgroup analysis revealed correspondences between acceptability profiles and demographic profiles. It is therefore essential for nurses and student nurses to receive training and become involved in the development of this new technologies. (A.

The present paper describes the development through Phases I-III. Methods Relevant QL issues were generated from literature search and from interviews with ophthalmologists, nurses, and patients with uveal melanoma representing three major treatment options: enucleation, plaque brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy. Results The provisional module was pretested in 61 patients from Finland, Sweden, and UK. The EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module consists of 26 items for all patients, and four additional items for patients receiving treatments other than enucleation. It measures ocular irritation, vision impairment, headache, worry about recurrent disease, problems with driving, problems with appearance functional problems due to vision impairment, and problems reading. Conclusions Several treatment modalities are available for uveal melanoma. There is limited knowledge of the impact of these treatments on QL in the long and short term. We hope that the OPT30 module together with the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire can be a useful tool in research.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the translation of the IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 1) and to assess the applicability, validity, reliability and sensitivity of the instrument in both males and females with LUTS in Chinese population.Methods: The translation of the IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 1) was reviewed through back translation. Modifications were made, resulting in the development of The IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 2). The content validity was assessed by contend validity index. 233 subjects with LUTS were recruited in Hong Kong primary care settings for pilot psychometric testing. The construct validity was assessed by corrected item-total correlation and Pearson's correlation test against ICIQ-UI SF, IIQ-7 and SF-12 v2. The reliability was assessed by the internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha coefficient) and test -retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient). The Sensitivity was determined by performing known group comparisons by independent T-test.Results: The content validity index for all items could reach 1. Corrected item-total correlation scores were ≥0.4 for four symptom questions (feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, intermittency, weak stream and straining). Overall, the total symptom score moderately correlated with ICIQ-UI SF. The quality of life score moderately correlated with the IIQ-7 but weakly correlated with SF-12 v2. Overall, the reliability of the IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 2) was acceptable (Cronbach's Alpha coefficient = 0.71, ICC of the symptom questions =0.8, ICC of the quality of life question =0.7). The symptoms questions and quality of life questions of the IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese versions 2) were sensitive in detecting differences between groups.Conclusions: The IPSS (Hong Kong Chinese version 2) is a valid, reliable and sensitive measure to assess Chinese females and males with lower urinary tract symptoms. The IPSS quality of life question is more sensitive than the generic quality of life measure to differentiate subgroups. © 2014 Choi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Methods and Materials Six hundred eighty patients were treated with iodine-125 brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer. IPSS, OABSS, and two categories of IPSS questions (storage symptom score [IPSS-S] and voiding symptom score [IPSS-V]) were evaluated. Results The median followup was 54 months (range, 24–108). All scales showed rapid increases followed by gradual decreases. The median times to IPSS peak and resolution were 1 and 6 months, respectively. The resolution rates of IPSS, IPSS-S, IPSS-V, and OABSS at the last followup were 84.2%, 86.3%, 89.5%, and 83.0%, respectively. The difference between IPSS baseline and peak was greater for larger preimplant prostate volumes (≥25 mL, p = 0.004). The time to resolution was longer for higher biologic effective dose (BED) (≥210 Gy, p = 0.019 [IPSS]), in those with larger prostate volumes (≥25 mL, p = 0.025 [OABSS]), in younger patients (younger than 70 years, p = 0.043 [IPSS-S]), and in those with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use (p = 0.049 [IPSS-V]). Urge incontinence, included in the OABSS, was observed more commonly in older patients (75 years and older, p = 0.018), with ADT use (p < 0.001), and for higher BED (≥210 Gy, p = 0.006). Conclusions The IPSS and OABSS showed similar patterns of change. Urinary symptoms improved more rapidly in those with high baseline IPSS levels. The OABSS was useful for following urinary symptoms after prostate brachytherapy. Age, ADT use, preimplant prostate volume, and BED were significantly associated with urinary outcomes.},

   abstract = {Objective: To investigate variation in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) in men following prostate brachytherapy. Methods: From January 2004 to November 2009, 524 consecutive patients underwent prostate brachytherapy either alone or in combination with external beam radiation therapy for T1c-T3b prostate cancer. The IPSS was assessed preimplant and at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after treatment. Clinical and treatment-related factors were assessed for correlations with the IPSS increase. Results: The mean preimplant IPSS was 7.4, with the greatest mean score of 16.0 at 1 month. At 6 months, the mean total IPSS had decreased to 11.5, but it was still statistically significantly greater than that at baseline (<0.001). At 12 months, the IPSS was decreased to 8.6, slightly greater than baseline (p = 0.001). The IPSS of 45.4 % (69/152) patients gradually returned to preimplant levels and that of 71.1 % (108/152) patients returned to within 3 points of the baseline at 24 months. At 24, 36, and 48 months after seed implantation, the IPSS was 8.6, 7.7, and 8.2, respectively, and none of these values differed statistically significantly from baseline (p > 0.05). Sixteen patients (3.1 %) showed AUR, and 11 patients required catheterization. On univariate and multivariate analyses, the IPSS increase was best predicted by lower preimplant IPSS. Conclusion: In our series, IPSS after prostate brachytherapy peaked at 1 month and gradually returned to approximately baseline at 24 months. The IPSS increase was best predicted by lower preimplant IPSS. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Objective To develop and validate an Arabic version of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Patients, Subjects and Methods An Arabic version of the IPSS (IPSS-Arb) was developed through a series of translations and modifications which involved the authors, urology and non-urology medical and nursing staff. The validity and reliability were assessed in 76 patients with urinary symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in 63 control subjects without BPH; 25 patients had transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) whereas the remaining 51 patients were treated with terazosin. The reliability of the IPSS-Arb was assessed by determining the internal consistency (Cronbach's α coefficient) and by assessing the test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC). Construct validity was assessed by determining the correlation between the IPSS-Arb scores and the quality-of-life question (QoL-Arb), and by determining the ability of the IPSS-Arb to discriminate between the patients and controls by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results The Cronbach's α coefficient (internal consistency) for the IPSS-Arb was 0.85, and 0.78-0.88 for the individual items. The test-retest reliability (ICC) was 0.88 (P < 0.001). In addition, the IPSS-Arb had a high correlation with the QoL-Arb (Spearman rank correlation coefficient 0.82, P = 0.01). The mean (sem, 95% confidence interval) area under the ROC curve for the IPSS-Arb was 0.93 (0.09, 0.89-0.97), whereas the area for its individual questions was 0.79-0.90. The IPSS-Arb also showed a high sensitivity to change. The mean (sd) IPSS-Arb scores before and after TURP were 23.1 (6.4) and 6.9 (1.8), respectively (P < 0.001); in the terazosin group, the scores were 12.6 (7.4) and 8.2 (4.0), respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The IPSS-Arb was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument for patients with BPH. We recommend using it for patient assessment and follow-up, and as a research tool in Arabic-speaking patients both in the Middle East and worldwide. In addition, this study provided another proof of the wide suitability of the IPSS among various nations worldwide. © 2009 BJU INTERNATIONAL.},

The current study aimed to characterize BPH-LUTS progression using responses to the IPSS, the QoL, and the BII in an integrated item response theory (IRT) framework and assess the Fisher information of each scale. The power of this approach to detect a drug effect was compared with an IRT approach considering only IPSS responses. A unidimensional and a bidimensional pharmacometric IRT model, based on item-level IPSS responses in a clinical trial with 403 patients, were extended by incorporating patients’ QoL and summary BII scores over the 6-month trial period. In the developed unidimensional integrated model, the QoL score was found to be the most informative, representing 17% of the total Fisher information, while the combined information content of the seven IPSS items represented 70.6%. In the bidimensional model, “storage” and both storage and “voiding” disability drove QoL and summary BII responses, respectively. Sample size reduction of 16% to detect a drug effect at 80% power was obtained with the unidimensional integrated IRT model compared with its counterpart IPSS IRT model. This study shows that utilizing the information content across the IPSS, QoL, and BII scales in an integrated IRT framework results in a modest but meaningful increase in power to detect a drug effect.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4-5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more.

An asymp-tomatic bacteriuria is not to be treated. In recurrent urinary tract infections , non-antibiotic prevention measures are recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians, who are involved in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, should familiarize themselves with the revised recommendations for the selection and dosage of antibiotic therapy of the updated clinical guideline. Antimicrobial stew-ardship aspects have significantly influenced the therapeutic recommendations. A broad implementation in all treatment groups is necessary to ensure a sustainable antibiotic policy and to improve care.},

CONCLUSIONS: The IPSS and OABSS showed similar patterns of change. Urinary symptoms improved more rapidly in those with high baseline IPSS levels. The OABSS was useful for following urinary symptoms after prostate brachytherapy. Age, ADT use, preimplant prostate volume , and BED were significantly associated with urinary outcomes. Ó},

   abstract = {Background: Inequalities in health have received considerable attention from health scientists and economists. In South Africa, inequalities exist in socio-economic status (SES) and in access to basic social services and are exacerbated by inequalities in health. While health systems, together with the wider social determinants of health, are relevant in seeking to improve health status and health inequalities, those that need good quality health care too seldom get it. Studies on the burden of ill-health in South Africa have shown consistently that, relative to the wealthy, the poor suffer more from more disease and violence. However, these studies are based on selected disease conditions and only consider a single point in time. Trend analyses have yet to be produced. This paper specifically investigates socio-economic related health inequality in South Africa and seeks to understand how the burden of self-reported illness and disability is distributed and whether this has changed since the early 2000s. Methods. Several rounds (2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008) of the South African General Household Surveys (GHS) data were used, with standardized and normalized self-reported illness and disability concentration indices to assess the distribution of illness and disability across socio-economic groups. Composite indices of socio-economic status were created using a set of common assets and household characteristics. Results: This study demonstrates the existence of socio-economic gradients in self-reported ill-health in South Africa. The burden of the major categories of ill-health and disability is greater among lower than higher socio-economic groups. Even non-communicable diseases, which are frequently seen as diseases of affluence, are increasingly being reported by lower socio-economic groups. For instance, the concentration index of flu (and diabetes) declined from about 0.17 (0.10) in 2002 to 0.05 (0.01) in 2008. These results have also been confirmed internationally. Conclusion: The current burden and distribution of ill-health indicates how critical it is for the South African health system to strive for access to and use of health services that is in line with need for such care. Concerted government efforts, within both the health sector and other social and economic sectors are therefore needed to address the significant health inequalities in South Africa. © 2011 Ataguba et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: In recent decades, China has experienced tremendous economic growth and also witnessed growing socioeconomic-related health inequality. The study aims to explore the potential causes of socioeconomic-related health inequality in urban and rural areas of China over the past two decades. Methods: This study used six waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) from 1991 to 2006. The recentered influence function (RIF) regression decomposition method was employed to decompose socioeconomic-related health inequality in China. Health status was derived from self-rated health (SRH) scores. The analyses were conducted on urban and rural samples separately. Results: We found that the average level of health status declined from 1989 to 2006 for both urban and rural populations. Average health scores were greater for the rural population compared with those for the urban population. We also found that there exists pro-rich health inequality in China. While income and secondary education were the main factors to reduce health inequality, older people, unhealthy lifestyles and a poor home environment increased inequality. Health insurance had the opposite effects on health inequality for urban and rural populations, resulting in lower inequality for urban populations and higher inequality for their rural counterparts. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an effective way to reduce socioeconomic-related health inequality is not only to increase income and improve access to health care services, but also to focus on improvements in the lifestyles and the home environment. Specifically, for rural populations, it is particularly important to improve the design of health insurance and implement a more comprehensive insurance package that can effectively target the rural poor. Moreover, it is necessary to comprehensively promote the flush toilets and tap water in rural areas. For urban populations, in addition to promoting universal secondary education, healthy lifestyles should be promoted, including measures such as alcohol control.},

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2012 in Hamadan City, the west of Iran, on 1400 households enrolled through a stratified cluster random sampling method. The effect of inequity on health outcomes was investigated via a three-stage procedure including: (a) definition of health outcomes; (b) measuring socioeconomic status using an asset index; and (c) measuring inequality of health outcome using concentration index.
Results: There was inequality for all outcomes of interest. The prevalence of low birth weight, underweight, stunting, wasting, minor injuries, moderate injuries, consanguineous marriage, children with disability, short birth spacing, and adolescent pregnancy was disproportionately more common among the poor. On the other hand, the prevalence of preterm birth, nonexclusive breastfeeding, severe injuries, incomplete health care, cesarean section, and advanced maternal age was disproportionately more common among the rich.
Conclusions: According to our results, there is a health inequality between the poor and the rich subgroups which may increase the risk of mothers and infant mortality and morbidity rates among the poor while the majority of the conditions related to the health outcomes are preventable.},

   abstract = {Background: Socioeconomic-related inequalities in health are a major public health challenge in both developed and developing countries. Little evidence is available on socioeconomic-related inequalities in health in different regions of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Aims: This study aimed to determine socioeconomic-related inequality in poor self-rated health in adults in Kermanshah city, western Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study with stratified sampling obtained data on socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics , behavioural risk factors and self-rated health of 2040 adults (≥ 18 years) in Kermanshah city. A self-adminis-trated questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. The concentration (C) index and C curve were used to determine the socioeconomic-related inequality in poor self-rated health. A decomposition analysis of the C index was done to identify the factors explaining socioeconomic-related inequality in poor self-rated health. Results: The crude and age-adjusted prevalence of poor self-rated health was 13.8% and 18.1%, respectively. The estimated C for the whole sample was-0.295, indicating that poor SRH was concentrated in the poor. The decomposition results suggested that socioeconomic status (45.5%), having a chronic health condition (11.9%) and smoking (7.3%) were the main factors contributing to the concentration of poor self-rated health among those of lower socioeconomic status. Conclusion: The concentration of poor self-rated health among the poor in Kermanshah city warrants policy attention. Policies aimed at reducing inequality in wealth distribution and risky health behaviour and preventing chronic health conditions among the poor may mitigate socioeconomic-related inequalities in poor self-rated health in Kermanshah.},

   abstract = {Background: Population ageing in China has brought increasing attention to the health inequalities of the elderly. The purpose of this paper is to measure income-related health inequality among the elderly in China and decompose its causes. Methods: The data are from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) survey in 2013, which contains 6176 individuals aged 60 years and above. A multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of self-rated health (SRH) among the elder people. Furthermore, the corrected concentration index were used to measure income-related health inequality. Wagstaff-type decomposition analysis was employed to explore the cause of inequality. The measurement and decomposition of health inequality was also performed separately in the male and female subgroups. Results: Most elderly declared their health status as "fair" (51.33%) or "poor" (21.88%). Income, gender, residence, region, health insurance and other factors had significant association with SRH (P < 0.05). The corrected concentration index (CCI) was 0.06, indicating pro-rich inequality in health among the elderly. Decomposition analyses revealed that the main contributors to health inequality included income, residence, region, health insurance, and employment. For female elderly, most of the inequality was due to residence (50.78%) and income (49.51%); for male elderly, most of the inequality was due to insurance (38.65%) and income (22.26%); for the total sample, employment had a negative contribution to health inequality (- 25.83%). Conclusion: The findings confirm a high proportion of elderly with poor SRH, and health inequality in the Chinese. Some socioeconomic strategies should be conducted to reduce this health inequality among the elderly, such as reducing income disparities, consolidating health insurance schemes, and narrowing urban-rural and regional gaps. Older females with low incomes in rural areas are a vulnerable subgroup and warrant targeted policy attention.},

We used data from a nationally representative sample of Japanese men and women aged 20e59 years who participated in eight repeated cross-sectional surveys between 1986 and 2007. A concentration index (CI) was used to measure income-related inequalities in self-rated health (SRH) and decomposed into contributing factors. We then examined temporal changes in CIs and their contributing factors. Results showed that income-related inequalities in SRH, unfavourable to low-income groups, persisted throughout the study period. Despite widening income inequalities, inequalities in SRH narrowed during the period of economic stagnation since the late 1990s because of the profound deterioration in SRH among middle-to high-income groups. Decomposition analysis showed that income itself and unemployment or economic inactivity were the most important contributors to inequalities in SRH for both sexes at almost all time points. However, from 1986 to 2007, the relative contribution of income to these inequalities decreased from 78% to 14% in men and from 85% to 38% in women. By contrast, the relative contribution of unemployment or economic inactivity increased from 18% to 77% in men and from 10% to 31% in women. Our results suggest that a reduction in avoidable health inequalities could be achieved by reducing the influence of unemployment or economic inactivity on health.},

This study, therefore, measured the extent of income-related inequalities in self-reported depression and self-rated health (SRH) among married immigrants in South Korea and decomposed them into sociodemographic determinants using data from the 2015 National Survey of Multicultural Families (n = 15,231). The mean age of this sample was 37.8 years (SD = 10.8) and the mean duration of residence was 10.1 years (SD = 7.4). Eighty-five percent were female, and of these, 86.5% were from low/middle-income countries. Of these married immigrants, 34.6% reported experiences of depressive symptoms in the past year, and 9.5% reported their current health to be poor or very poor (weighted). The results also indicated substantial pro-rich health inequalities with the Erreygers concentration index of -0.1298 for self-reported depression and that of -0.1231 for poor SRH. Socioeconomic positions, reflected in income, subjective social status, and employment status, alongside satisfaction with a spouse, appeared to have much greater contributions to the overall inequality than demographics and type of migration. These findings suggest that social welfare policies and programmes can play important roles in reducing health inequalities that are ‘avoidable and unnecessary’ among married immigrants in South Korea.},

   abstract = {Using representative survey data of the German SocioEconomic Panel Study (SOEP) for 2006, we show that the magnitude of health inequality measures like the concentration index (CI) depends crucially on the underlying health measure. The highest degree of inequality is found when dichotomized subjective health measures like health satisfaction or self-assessed health (SAH) are employed. With the use of SF12, a generic health measure, the inequality indicator is reduced by a factor of ten. We show that the process of dichotomizing variables leads to such huge differences. Cardinalizing SAH by means of the SF12 leads to similar results to those with the pure SF12 measure. Employing generic health measures used with other populations like the Canadian HUI-III or the Finnish 15D to cardinalize SAH has a significant impact on the degree of inequality measured. Finally, by contrasting the physical health component of the SF12 to the unambiguously objective grip strength measure, we provide evidence of the presence of income-related reporting heterogeneity in generic health measures. Introduction and background During the last decade, measuring health inequalities has become increasingly popular. Many analyses use subjective health measures to calculate health inequality indices. To evaluate policies and to draw reliable policy recommendations, one would ideally like to base the empirical assessments on objective health measures that are comprehensive, free of measurement errors, cleaned of socioeconomic and language-related biases in the reporting behavior and that are collected consistently over time. Economists view health as an input factor that determines productivity in household production functions or in wage functions , which is another reason why they prefer the use of objective over subjective health measures. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the sensitivity of the most popular health inequality indicator with respect to the health measure used. We focus on Germany and use data that incorporate a rich set of different health measures. In general, health measures can be classified as a) Subjective health measures such as health satisfaction or self-assessed health (SAH): SAH is the most popular health measure and most studies on health inequalities in developed countries rely on it. b) Generic health measures such as the SF12, the HUI-III, or the 15D: these health measures are presumably objective and comprehensive. They are generated from self-reported questions , which cover various health dimensions and are aggre-gated into a single index. Henceforth, we refer to them as quasi-objective. c) Vignette-based health measures: Respondents are asked to rate their own health and those of fictitious individuals. From this, the respondent's "true" health status is derived. d) Objective health measures such as height at certain age or grip strength: they are based on diagnosis by physicians or use invasive or non-invasive procedures. Reporting heterogeneity, which is sometimes also called "state dependent reporting bias" or "scale of reference bias" points towards the finding that some population groups may systematically rate their health status as different from others. There is evidence that cultural as well as semantic differences vary in a systematic way with the response behavior (Bago d'Uva, O'Donnell, & van Doorslaer, 2008; Jürges, 2007; Mathers & Douglas, 1998). While these findings are challenges for crosscountry comparisons, the phenomenon of differential reporting also exists within countries when samples are stratified by education, age, gender, or income. Older people tend to judge their health more mildly, whereas the findings for gender, education, and income are mixed, depending on the country (Bago d'Uva et al},

   abstract = {In recent work on international comparisons of income-related inequalities in health, the concentration index has been used as a measure of health inequality. A drawback of this measure is that it is sensitive to whether it is estimated with respect to health or morbidity. An alternative would be to use the generalized concentration index that is based on absolute rather than relative health differences. In this methodological paper, we explore the importance of the choice of health inequality measure by comparing the income-related inequality in health status and morbidity between Sweden and Australia. This involves estimating a concentration index and a generalized concentration index for the eight-scale health profile of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey. We then transform the scores for each scale into a measure of morbidity and show that whether the concentration index is estimated with respect to health or morbidity has an impact on the results. The ranking between the two countries is reversed for two of the eight dimensions of SF-36 and within both countries the ranking across the eight SF-36 scales is also affected. However, this change in ranking does not occur when the generalized concentration index is compared and we conclude with the implications of these results for reporting comparisons of income-related health inequality in different populations. r},

   abstract = {Background: Equity in medical resource utilization is a crucial concern in countries with national health insurance systems. From the perspective of an active aging framework, public health insurance is one of the pillars of economic security, as suggested by the World Bank, to achieve the goal of social security for older adults. This study thus sought to quantify income-related inequality in national health insurance systems, especially during the global economic crisis of 2007-2008. Methods: By employing the Taiwan National Health Interview Surveys (2005 and 2009) datasets, we analyzed the socioeconomic inequality of outpatient service utilization for older Taiwanese adults during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. We used corrected concentration indices (CCIs) to examine inequalities over time. Furthermore, we decomposed socioeconomic inequalities to reveal the contributions of determinant factors. The dependent variables related to whether participants had used outpatient services in the previous month, and the independent factors included individual's needs, enabling, predisposing, and environmental factors proposed by Andersen model. Results: The sample consisted of 2415 observations in 2005 and 2554 observations in 2009. The income-related health care inequality was minor from pro-rich to pro-poor across the study duration, although the difference was insignificant (women: from a concentration index [CI] of 0.0256 in 2005 to a CI of-0.0098 in 2009; men: from a CI of 0.0379 in 2005 to a CI of 0.0310 in 2009). We used a probit model to analyze the effect of explanatory factors on outpatient resource utilization by men and women. After other factors were controlled for, we found that that the income variable had a positive and significant effect on outpatient service utilization in 2009 and the absolute contribution of income to inequality notably increased from 0.0480 in 2005 to 0.3247 in 2009 for older women. Conclusions: In conclusion, Taiwan's National Health Insurance system guarantees the accessibility of health care services to older adults, but slight income-related inequality was maintained in the outpatient resource utilization of women during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Close attention should be paid to the vulnerability of women during times of economic insecurity.},

   abstract = {The Great Recession in Europe sparked concerns that the crisis would lead to increased income related health inequalities (IRHI). Did this come to pass, and what role, if any, did government transfers play in the evolution of these inequalities? Motivated by these questions, this paper seeks to (i) study the evolution of IRHI during the crisis, and (ii) decompose these evolutions to examine the separate roles of government versus market transfers. Using panel data for 7 EU countries from 2004 to 2013, we find no evidence that IRHI persistently rose after 2008, even in countries most affected by the crisis. Our decomposition reveals that, while the health of the poorest did indeed worsen during the crisis, IRHI were prevented from increasing by the relative stickiness of old age pension benefits compared to the market incomes of younger groups. Austerity measures weakened the IRHI reducing effect of government transfers.},

This paper implements a new decomposition approach using the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1991-2006) to examine the extent to which changes in level and distribution of incomes and in income mobility are related to health disparities between rich and poor. We find that health disparities in China relate to rising income inequality and in particular to the adverse health and income experience of older (wo)men, but not to the growth rate of average incomes over the last decades. These findings suggest that replacement incomes and pensions at older ages may be one of the most important policy levers for reducing health disparities between rich and poor Chinese.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To determine whether early changes in International Prostate Symptom Score predict final improvement in the quality of life and treatment satisfaction of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia receiving tadalafil. Methods: This post-hoc analysis of three randomized-controlled trials of tadalafil for lower urinary tract symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia used subpopulations based on treatment status (tadalafil, placebo) and region (Japan, Asia). Logistic regression, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis were applied to individual International Prostate Symptom Score and Patient Global Impression of Improvement response scores. Results: From logistic regression, most individual International Prostate Symptom Score items predicted either International Prostate Symptom Score remitter or responder status; only International Prostate Symptom Score Quality of Life predicted Patient Global Impression of Improvement responder status in tadalafil-treated patients. Among tadalafil-treated patients, principal component analysis showewd that improvement of International Prostate Symptom Score items 2, 4, 7 and International Prostate Symptom Score Quality of Life at early visits were associated with Patient Global Impression of Improvement (final visit), whereas International Prostate Symptom Score items 1, 3, 5 and 6 at early visits were associated with total International Prostate Symptom Score at the final visit. No clear predictive items for Patient Global Impression of Improvement and total International Prostate Symptom Score existed for placebo-treated patients. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the closest association was between International Prostate Symptom Score Quality of Life and International Prostate Symptom Score item 7 in placebo- and tadalafil-treated patients, which supports the principal component analysis results. Conclusions: Early changes of storage and voiding symptoms by tadalafil might lead to treatment satisfaction and overall International Prostate Symptom Score improvement, respectively. This finding could help physicians predict tadalafil treatment outcomes for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia.},

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivers fewer high-dose fractions of radiation, which may be radiobiologically favorable to the conventional low-dose external beam fractions. The urinary toxicity associated with SBRT, however, remains unclear in patients with a high IPSS (1). We report our experience using SBRT for localized prostate cancer in patients with pretreatment IPSS ≥ 15. Methods: Localized prostate cancer patients with a pre-treatment IPSS ≥ 15 treated with SBRT at Georgetown University Hospital from 2009 to 2016 were included in this retrospective review of prospectively collected data. These patients were treated to 35–36.25 Gy in five fractions delivered via CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Urinary toxicity was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4). Urinary quality of life was assessed using validated questionnaires (IPSS and EPIC-26). Results: 53 patients at a median age of 71 years (range 57–89 years) received SBRT with a minimum follow up of 3 years. The median prostate size was 37 cm3 (range 12–100 cm3) and 30.2% patients received ADT. The 3-years incidence rate of Grade 3 urinary toxicity was 7.5% with median time to toxicity of 2.9 years. There were no Grade 4 or 5 toxicities. A mean baseline IPSS score of 19.8 significantly decreased to 12.9 at 3 months post-SBRT (p = 0.002) and remained stable at 36 months (13.7). A mean baseline EPIC-26 obstructive/irritative score of 64.1 significantly improved to 80.2 at 3 months (p = 0.002). This improvement was maintained to 36 months. There was no significant change from the mean baseline EPIC-26 urinary incontinence score at any point during follow up. Conclusions: SBRT for clinically localized prostate cancer was well-tolerated in men with baseline IPSS ≥ 15 (1). Grade 3 toxicities occurred but resolved with time. Our data suggest that poor baseline urinary function does not worsen following SBRT and may even improve. High baseline IPSS score should not be considered a contraindication to SBRT.},

The Fisher information content of IPSS items was determined and the power to detect a drug effect using the IRT approach was examined. Data from 403 patients with moderate-to-severe BPH-LUTS in a placebo-controlled phase II trial studying the effect of degarelix over 6 months were used for modeling. Three pharmacometric models were developed: a model for total IPSS, a unidimensional IRT model, and a bidimensional IRT model, the latter separating voiding and storage items. The population-level time course of BPH-LUTS in all models was described by initial improvement followed by worsening. In the unidimensional IRT model, the combined information content of IPSS voiding items represented 72% of the total information content, indicating that the voiding subscore may be more sensitive to changes in BPH-LUTS compared with the storage subscore. The pharmacometric models showed considerably higher power to detect a drug effect compared with a cross-sectional and while-on-treatment analysis of covariance, respectively. Compared with the sample size required to detect a drug effect at 80% power with the total IPSS model, a reduction of 5.9% and 11.7% was obtained with the unidimensional and bidimensional IPSS IRT model, respectively. Pharmacometric IRT analysis of the IPSS within BPH-LUTS may increase the precision and efficiency of treatment effect assessment, albeit to a more limited extent compared with applications in other therapeutic areas.},

   abstract = {Purpose-Anxiety may serve as a major barrier to participation in AS. Intolerance of uncertainty-the tendency to perceive the potential for negative events as threatening-has been linked to cancer-related worry. Accordingly, we explored prospectively the relationship of intolerance of uncertainty with anxiety along with other clinical factors among men managed with AS for prostate cancer. Materials and Methods-From 2011-2014, 119 men with D'Amico low-risk prostate cancer participating in active surveillance completed the HADS, MAX-PC, IUS, and IPSS surveys. We evaluated the relationship between anxiety and IUS score after adjusting for patient characteristics, cancer information, and IPSS score using bivariable and multivariable analyses. Results-A number of men reported clinically significant anxiety on the generalized (n=18, 15.1%) and prostate-cancer-specific (n=17, 14.3%) scales. In bivariable analyses, men with moderate/severe urinary symptoms and higher IUS scores reported more generalized and prostate-cancer-specific anxiety than men with mild urinary symptoms and lower IUS scores, respectively (p≤0.008). Men with depressive symptoms (p=0.024) or family history of prostate cancer (p=0.006) experienced greater generalized anxiety. In multivariable analysis, IUS score was significantly associated with generalized (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.38) and prostate-cancerspecific anxiety (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.13-1.49) while moderate/severe urinary symptoms were associated with prostate-cancer-specific anxiety (OR 6.89, 95% CI 1.33-35.68). Conclusions-Intolerance of uncertainty and urinary symptoms may promote anxiety among men on AS for prostate cancer. Patient education, management of lower urinary tract symptoms, and behavioral interventions may lessen anxiety related to uncertainty intolerance and help maintain patient engagement in AS.},

The focus of the review is on the merits and weakness of existing tools, as well as a discussion of how to move the field forward, given that there is already a strong base of questionnaires. Some specific trends in health measurement include the use of item response theory and computer adaptive testing, but it is unclear to what extent they will be adopted within urology.

   abstract = {Having explored the definitions associated with exponential families and their robustness properties, we now turn to a study of somewhat more general parameterized distributions, developing connections between divergence measures and other geometric ideas such as the Fisher information. After this, we illustrate a few consequences of Fisher information for optimal estimators, which gives a small taste of the deep connections between information geometry, Fisher information, exponential family models. In the coming chapters, we show how Fisher information measures come to play a central role in sequential (universal) prediction problems. 8.1 Fisher information: definitions and examples We begin by defining the Fisher information. Let \{P θ \} θ∈Θ denote a parametric family of distributions on a space X , each where θ ∈ Θ ⊂ R d indexes the distribution. Throughout this lecture and the next, we assume (with no real loss of generality) that each P θ has a density given by p θ. Then the Fisher information associated with the model is the matrix given by I θ := E θ ∇ θ log p θ (X)∇ log p θ (X) ⊤ = E θ [ ˙ ℓ θ ˙ ℓ ⊤ θ ], (8.1.1) where the score function ˙ ℓ θ = ∇ θ log p θ (x) is the gradient of the log likelihood at θ (implicitly depending on X) and the expectation E θ denotes expectation taken with respect to P θ. Intuitively, the Fisher information captures the variability of the gradient ∇ log p θ ; in a family of distributions for which the score function ˙ ℓ θ has high variability, we intuitively expect estimation of the parameter θ to be easier-different θ change the behavior of ˙ ℓ θ-though the log-likelihood functional θ → E θ 0 [log p θ (X)] varies more in θ. Under suitable smoothness conditions on the densities p θ (roughly, that derivatives pass through expectations; see Remark 8.1 at the end of this chapter), there are a variety of alternate definitions of Fisher information. These smoothness conditions hold for exponential families, so at least in the exponential family case, everything in this chapter is rigorous. (We note in passing that there are more general definitions of Fisher information for more general families under quadratic mean differentiability; see, for example, van der Vaart [4].) First, we note that the score function has 71},

   abstract = {Objectives. To validate the use in Spain of a linguistically harmonized Spanish version of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS Sp), and to compare it with the original American scale (IPSS Am). Methods. Validity and reliability were studied in 59 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (age 50 years) and 68 control subjects without BPH (age 18 to 49 years). Construct validity was assessed by correlating IPSS Sp scores with the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI), and item 8 (quality of life) of the IPSS. Discriminatory power was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Reliability was evaluated using the test-retest method, and internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Sensitivity to change was expressed as the effect size in preintervention versus postintervention scores in 26 additional patients with BPH (age 50 years) who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. Results. Correlations of the IPSS Sp were 0.07 to 0.36 with EQ dimensions; 0.29 with the EQ visual analogue scale score; 0.14 to 0.41 with PGWBI dimensions; and 0.72 with item 8 of the IPSS. ROC area was 0.95 0.02 (standard error). Using a cutoff point of 7, sensitivity was 83% and specificity was 98%. Test-retest reliability was 0.92 and Cronbach's alpha was 0.79. Mean preoperative and postoperative IPSS Sp scores were 25.56 and 8.48, respectively (P 0.001). Overall effect size was 2.52. These results are similar to those of the original American scale. Conclusions. This Spanish translation of the IPSS is valid, reliable, and sensitive to clinical change and has demonstrated equivalent psychometric properties to the original American instrument. Scores obtained with the two instruments can therefore be reliably compared and aggregated when statistically appropriate. UROLOGY 52: 614-620, 1998.},

Yet the most recent and forceful challenge to assimilationist research—transnational urbanism—is also influenced by distinctive contemporary circumstances and epistemological priorities, creating a tense and unproductive dichotomy. We contend that such apparently fundamental theoretical disputes are at least partially resolved through methodological pluralism. Understanding continuity and change in immigrant settlement and housing patterns requires that we draw on the distinct, complementary merits of transnational urbanist and spatial assimilation models—while also recognising the features of American urban development and race relations that create powerful incentives shaping the spatial trajectories of immigrant upward mobility. We evaluate these considerations through empirical case studies of the recent rise of home-ownership among Hmong immigrants in St Paul, Minnesota, and the interrelations between immigration and the intensified mortgage capitalisation of US housing markets.

Such problems are believed to be hindering the adoption of sustainable forest management (SFM) and forest certification by forest farmers in China. Two strategies were introduced by the Chinese government with the purpose of addressing these issues, namely forest tenure reforms and their associated supporting mechanism, forestry property markets. Through two case studies in southern China, we investigated the effectiveness of the two strategies as well as their implications for the adoption of SFM and forest certification. The two cases were Yong'an in Fujian province and Tonggu in Jiangxi province. Personal interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with small-scale forest farmers who had already benefited from the two strategies as well as market officers working for the two selected forestry property markets. The study identified eight issues constraining the potential adoption of SFM and certification in China, including limited finance, poorly developed infrastructure and transport systems, insecure forest tenures, inconsistent forest policies, low levels of awareness, illegal forest management practices, lack of local cooperative organizations, and inadequate knowledge and technical transfer. We found that the new forest tenure reforms and forestry property markets had generally fulfilled their original objectives and had the capacity to assist in addressing many of the issues facing forests prior to the reforms.},

   abstract = {Most people, when they think about microeconomics, think first about the slogan supply equals demand and its picture, shown here in Figure 1.1, with a rising supply function intersecting a falling demand function, determining an equilibrium price and quantity. supply demand price quantity equilibrium quantity equilibrium price Figure 1.1. Supply equals demand But before getting to this picture and the concept of an equilibrium, the pic-ture's constituent pieces, the demand and supply functions, are needed. Those functions arise from choices, choices by firms and by individual consumers. Hence, microeconomic theory begins with choices. Indeed, the theory not only begins with choices; it remains focused on them for a very long time. Most of this volume concerns modeling the choices of consumers, with some attention paid to the choices of profit-maximizing firms; only toward the end do we seriously worry about equilibrium. 1.1. Consumer Choice: The Basics The basic story of consumer choice is easily told: Begin with a set X of possible objects that might be chosen and an individual, the consumer, who does the choosing. The consumer faces limits on what she might choose, and so we imagine some collection A of nonempty subsets of X from which the consumer might choose. We let A denote a typical element of A; that is, A is a subset of X. Then the choices of our consumer are denoted by c(A).},

Objective: Our aim was to explore PCa risk reduction in men with benign prostatic hyperpla-sia (BPH) from the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (CombAT) study, in which biopsies were undertaken for cause. Design, setting, and participants: CombAT was a 4-yr randomized double-blind parallel group study in 4844 men !50 yr of age with clinically diagnosed moderate to severe BPH, International Prostate Symptom Score !12, prostate volume !30 ml, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 1.5-10 ng/ml. Men underwent annual PSA measurement and digital rectal examination (DRE), and prostate biopsies were performed for cause. Intervention: All patients took tamsulosin 0.4 mg/d, dutasteride 0.5 mg/d, or a combination of both. Measurements: The primary end point was incidence of PCa. Secondary end points included postbaseline prostate biopsy rates and Gleason score of cancers. Results and limitations: Dutasteride (alone or in combination with tamsulosin) was associated with a 40% RRR of PCa diagnosis compared with tamsulosin monotherapy (95% confidence interval, 16-57%; p = 0.002) and a 40% reduction in the likelihood of biopsy. There were similar reductions in low-and high-grade Gleason score cancers. The biopsy rate in the groups receiving dutasteride trended toward a higher diagnostic yield (combination: 29%, dutaste-ride: 28%, tamsulosin: 24%). One limitation was the lack of a standardized approach to PCa diagnosis and grading. Conclusions: Dutasteride, alone or in combination with tamsulosin, significantly reduced the relative risk of PCa diagnosis in men with BPH undergoing annual DRE and PSA screening. Consistent with the increased usefulness of PSA for PCa detection, men receiving dutasteride had a numerically lower biopsy rate and higher yield of PCa on biopsy.

   abstract = {Objective: In patients with prostate cancer (PCa), prostate enlargement may give rise to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS); many patients suffer from moderate-to-severe symptoms. We compare the efficacy of degarelix and goserelin plus bicalutamide in improving LUTS in PCa patients. Methods: Data were pooled from three Phase 3, randomized clinical trials of once-monthly treatment for 12 weeks with degarelix (240/80 mg; n = 289) or goserelin (3.6 mg) plus bicalutamide (50 mg; n = 174) for initial flare protection. LUTS at weeks 4, 8, and 12 were compared to baseline. Clinically relevant LUTS relief was a ≥3-point International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) decrease. Adverse events were assessed throughout the trials. Results: Patients receiving degarelix had significantly greater decreases in IPSS vs. goserelin at week 12 (adjusted difference: −1.24; 95% CI −2.33 to −0.14, P = 0.03). Clinically relevant LUTS relief with degarelix was especially pronounced in patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS (baseline IPSS ≥13) (odds ratio; OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.19–4.47, P = 0.01) and advanced PCa (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.10–5.04, P = 0.03). A twofold higher OR for early (week 4) LUTS relief was seen with degarelix vs. goserelin (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.14–3.60, P = 0.02). No difference in total prostate volume or urinary tract infection-related adverse events (2%) was seen between treatment groups. Conclusion: An early, significant and clinically more pronounced improvement of LUTS, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS or advanced PCa, was seen with degarelix vs. goserelin plus bicalutamide.},

   abstract = {Introduction: We sought to determine if prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with worse lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) than matched benign prostates, with attention to cancer characteristics, in a contemporary cohort. Methods: Using a single-institution database (January 1, 2009‒ June 30, 2013), men diagnosed with PCa on biopsy and controls with negative biopsies were matched 1:1 on age, prostate volume, and a propensity score predicting the probability of PCa diagnosis. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was compared between PCa cases and controls using paired statistics, stratifying on grade, cancer volume, stage, and D’Amico risk group. Sensitivity analyses were performed separately, repeating the match for high-grade, high-volume, and high-stage cancers only, and excluding users of benign prostatic hyperplasia medications. Results: In our cohort of 1330 men (665 with PCa), there were 284 (42.7%) Gleason 6 cancers (Grade Group 1), 315 (47.4%) Gleason 7 cancers (Grade Group 2‒3), and 66 (9.9%) Gleason 8‒10 cancers (Grade Group 4‒5). There was no difference in IPSS between PCa cases (median 6.5, interquartile range [IQR] 3‒12) and benign controls (median 7, IQR 3‒13; p=0.34). Subgroup analyses based on cancer grade, volume, or stage, showed no significant differences in IPSS between men with and without PCa, except among men with cT2b-cT4 PC (median 9, IQR 5‒16) vs. matched benign counterparts (median 8, IQR 3‒12; p=0.03). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Conclusions: Modern PCa does not appear to be associated with worse LUTS compared to benign prostates of the same size. Outlet obstruction is likely a late event in the natural history of PCa. This has implications for timely PCa detection, which should ideally be prior to the onset of LUTS.},

   abstract = {Screening for early prostate cancer is frequently employed in the routine management of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), but the evidence-base linking LUTS with prostate cancer is limited. We assessed the association of LUTS with a subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis in a prospective cohort study based on 21,159 Norwegian men who completed baseline questionnaires, including the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire, between 1995 and 2007 as part of the second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT 2). Men were followed-up for prostate cancer incidence and mortality from the date of clinical examination to end 2005. During a mean of 9 years follow-up, 518 incident prostate cancers were diagnosed and 74 men died from prostate cancer. Men with severe LUTS (IPSS 20-35) had a 2.26-fold (95% CI: 1.49-3.42) increased risk of prostate cancer compared to men reporting no symptoms. A positive association was observed for localized (hazard ratio, HR: 4.61; 2.23-9.54), but not advanced (HR: 0.51; 0.15-1.75), cancers (p for heterogeneity <0.001). There was no evidence that moderate/severe symptoms (IPSS 8-35) were associated with prostate cancer mortality (HR: 0.83; 0.42-1.64) vs. no symptoms. Amongst 518 men with prostate cancer, there was a 46% lower (10-68%) risk of death with moderate/severe symptoms vs. no symptoms. We conclude that LUTS are positively associated with localized, but not advanced or fatal, prostate cancer, suggesting that urinary symptoms are not caused by prostate cancer. Thus, screening for early cancers on the basis of LUTS may not be justified. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Aims: Previous studies have shown that non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension, atherosclerotic disease manifestations, tallness, obesity, dyslipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and high alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) levels are risk factors for development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This indicates that BPH is a component of the metabolic syndrome. In a subsequent study, we found that there was an association between the BPH growth rate and the development of clinical prostate cancer. These findings generated a hypothesis that clinical prostate cancer also was a component of the metabolic syndrome. In the present study, this hypothesis was tested on 299 patients with recently diagnosed clinical prostate cancer. If this hypothesis is true, patients with clinical prostate cancer of high stage and grade would have a larger prostate gland volume, a faster BPH growth rate and a more pronounced clinical, haemodynamic, anthropometric, metabolic and insulin profile than patients with clinical prostate cancer of low stage and grade have. Methods: Two hundred and ninety-nine patients in whom clinical prostate cancer was diagnosed were consecutively included. The prevalence of NIDDM, treated hypertension and atherosclerotic manifestations was provided by the respective patient's medical history. Body length, body weight, waist measurement, hip measurement and blood pressure were determined. Body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Blood samples were drawn to determine triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, uric acid, ALAT and the fasting plasma insulin level. The prostate gland volume was measured using transrectal ultrasound. The annual BPH growth rate was calculated. The prostate cancer diagnosis was established. Results: Patients with clinical prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 50 ng/ml, stage T3, had a bigger prostate gland volume (p < 0.001), a faster BPH growth rate (p < 0.001), were more obese, as measured by body weight (p = 0.062), BMI (p = 0.003), waist measurement (p = 0.011) and hip measurement (p = 0.051) and showed a higher systolic blood pressure (p < 0.070) than patients with T2 clinical prostate cancer. When patients with clinical prostate cancer, PSA >50 ng/ml, were included at the comparison, T3 tumour patients showed a higher prevalence of treated hypertension (p = 0.026) than patients with T2 tumours. Patients with clinical prostate cancer, PSA <50 ng/ml, G3, had a greater prostate gland volume (p = 0.004), a faster BPH growth rate (p = 0.005) and were more obese as determined by waist measurement (p = 0.044) and WHR (p = 0.073). Moreover, subjects with a G3 tumour were more dyslipidaemic, as shown by a higher triglyceride level (p = 0.019) and a lower HDL-cholesterol level (p = 0.005), and were more hyperuricaemic (p = 0.023), showed a higher plasma insulin level (p = 0.019) and a higher ALAT level (p = 0.061) than those with a G1 tumour. When patients with clinical prostate cancer, PSA >50 ng/ml, were included at the comparison, G3 patients had a greater prostate gland volume (p = 0.002) and a faster BPH growth rate (p = 0.003) than patients with G1 tumours. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that the prostate gland volume, the BPH growth rate, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and high ALAT levels are risk factors for the development of clinical prostate cancer. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that clinical prostate cancer is a component of the metabolic syndrome. Patients with clinical prostate cancer may have the same metabolic abnormality of a defective insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and secondary hyperinsulinaemia as patients with the metabolic syndrome. Our data also support the hypothesis that hyperinsulinaemia is a promoter of clinical prostate cancer. © 2004 Taylor & Francis on licence from Blood Pressure.},

This study included 216 patients treated with IMRT between 2006 and 2010. Patients were evaluated in three groups according to baseline IPSS as defined by the American Urological Association classification, where IPSSs of 0 to 7, 8 to 19, and 20 to 35 represent mild (n = 124), moderate (n = 70), and severe (n = 22) symptom groups, respectively. The average IPSSs ± standard deviation at baseline vs. those at 24 months after IMRT were 3.5 ± 2.1 vs. 5.1 ± 3.6 in the mild group (P < 0.001), 12.6 ± 3.4 vs. 10.0 ± 6.0 in the moderate group (P = 0.0015), and 23.8 ± 2.9 vs. 14.4 ± 9.1 in the severe group (P < 0.001). Among factors of patient and treatment characteristics, age, IPSS classification, pretreatment GU medications, and positive biopsy rates were associated with the IPSS difference between baseline and 24 months (P = 0.023, < 0.001, 0.044, and 0.028, respectively). In conclusion, patients with moderate to severe urinary symptoms can exhibit improvement in urinary function after IMRT, whereas patients with mild symptoms may have slightly worsened functions. Age, baseline IPSS, GU medications, and tumor burden in the prostate can have an effect on the IPSS changes.},

Materials and Methods: Retrospective study of 74 patients, who underwent TURP between 2008-2015, after failed medical therapy for LUTS with BPE with bladder underactivity. Clinical history, International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life score, physical examination including digital rectal examination, renal function test, urinalysis, post void residual urine measurement, serum prostate-specific antigen, cystourethroscopy, transrectal ultrasonography and urodynamic study were recorded. Patients having history of congenital or acquired neurologic conditions, neurogenic bladder, spinal trauma or surgery, pelvic trauma or surgery, diabetes mellitus with end organ damage, urethral pathology or surgery, prostatic cancer were excluded from study Results: The mean follow-up period was 22.4 +/- 6.2 months (range, 3-43 months). Mean prostate volume was 42.8 +/- 6.4 ml. and mean serum PSA was 2.3 +/- 1.8 ng/ml. IPSS changed from 24.6 +/- 4.2 (Storage-13.8 +/- 3.2, Voiding-10.8 +/- 2.8) preoperatively to 10.8 +/- 5.8 (Storage-6.2 +/- 2.8, Voiding-4.6 +/- 1.8) postoperatively which was found statistically significant. QOL score changed from 4.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.6 +/- 0.4. Twenty-two patients out of 174 (12.64%) remained on per-urethral catheter or CIC due to voiding failure after TURP beyond 1 month. Conclusions: TURP should be considered a viable treatment option in men with enlarged prostate with hypocontractile detrusor.

   abstract = {Purpose: To report the urinary outcome of men treated for prostate cancer with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) who have pretreatment obstructive urinary symptoms (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] $15). Methods and Materials: We treated 368 patients with EBRT for localized prostate cancer, and pre-and post-radiotherapy (RT) IPSSs were recorded. In total, 80 men had an IPSS $15, 48% of whom were taking genitouri-nary (GU) medications before RT. The IPSS was followed over time and analyzed as a pretreatment factor against Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute and late GU toxicity. Results: The median follow-up was 44 months. Among men with a pre-RT IPSS $15, the median IPSS at baseline, first follow-up, and last follow-up was 18 (range, 15 to 34), 17 (range, 0 to 32), and 13 (range, 0 to 34), respectively. The mean patient declines in IPSS from baseline to first and last follow-up were À3.6 points (p < 0.0004) and À6.9 points (p < 0.0001), respectively. At last follow-up, 43 men (54%) took GU medications. Pre-RT IPSS $15 vs. #14 was associated with a higher incidence of Grade $2 acute GU toxicity (64% vs. 42%, p = 0.0005), and 4-year freedom from Grade $2 late GU toxicity was 38% vs. 64% (p < 0.0001). There was no greatly increased risk of Grade $3 late GU toxicity for men with IPSS $15 (4-year freedom from Grade $3 late GU toxicity of 90% vs. 96%, p = 0.0964). Conclusions: Although the improvement is not immediate, men with moderate to severe obstructive GU symptoms can have improvement in urinary function after EBRT, without significant risk for severe morbidity.

   abstract = {Objective: Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of Benign Prostatic Obstruction (BPO) cause a reduction in quality of life, but the magnitude of that reduction cannot be estimated empirically. This is because survey instruments currently available merely sum the symptoms found, but do not value their impact on quality of life. It is therefore dif®cult to determine whether the effects of treatments for LUTS suggestive of BPO justify the costs. This complicates economic evaluations. Methods: We valued the impact on quality of life of patients with LUTS suggestive of BPO, by valuing health states de®ned by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) using the time trade-off (TTO). TTO values ranged from 1.0 for perfect health to 0.0 for the value of death, and can be used to calculate Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), the preferred outcome measure in health economics. Results: We reduced the number of health states de®ned by the IPSS using factor analysis. The resulting nine health states were valued by a representative sample of the general public (N  170) using TTO. The worst IPSS health state was valued at 0.87. Conclusion: The values for health states de®ned by the IPSS revealed that LUTS suggestive of BPO has a mild impact on quality of life. The valuation of the IPSS facilitates economic evaluations of treatments for LUTS suggestive of BPO, because QALYs (the preferred outcome measure in health economics) can be determined empirically.},

   abstract = {Although it is obvious that research regarding Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) is context specific and developed over time, not many research papers yet intended to investigate these changes. As a matter of fact, the number of scientific publications addressing SFM is relatively high. Hence, such a wide field cannot be sufficiently covered by traditional literature review approaches. With this paper, we aim at identifying the most convergent narratives within the SFM-research landscape by applying a text mining methodology to recent scientific literature. By doing so, we generated results that indicate that there may have been three phases in the evolution of SFM-research: the early phase covers in particular issues regarding land use in tropical and developing countries. Furthermore, papers in this phase tend to focus on general concepts or policy issues. In contrast, the second phase is characterized by a larger share of publications in forestry focused journals. This process is seemingly connected with issues like forest management, certification, forest stand management and the development of sustainability indicators. A third phase can be observed by the relative downturn of publications in forest-focused journals between 2005 and 2010. A new focus in this period is climate change.},

In many areas, the distribution and use of licks in the landscape is poorly known, rendering planning for resource development difficult, We examined lick use by 28 GPS radio-collared mountain goats in 2 study areas in southeastern British Columbia during 20042005, Viewing collar-location movements on digital orthophotos, we assumed goat use of 6 previously known and 10 suspected mineral licks. Field visits verified that 9 of the 10 suspected sites were mineral licks, Thirteen of the 1.5 licks used by collared goats were within forests with commercial harvesting potential. All but 3 of the licks were ≤600 m from the closest logging block, and 5 licks were <100 m away, Number of annual visits to licks by individual goats ranged from 0 to 9. Goats often moved considerable distances (up to 17.3 km) to visit licks. Most visits by males occurred between early May and late June (median 9 June), and most visits by females occurred between early June and mid-July (median 21 June). Mean time spent at licks on each visit was 1.5 days for females and 1.6 days for males. Most of the licks were characterized by numerous cavities dug under trees (which we term "lick trees"). Using GPS collars, we were able to collect data on lower-elevation mineral licks not previously known to researchers.},

We evaluated the most common timber production systems worldwide in terms of their impact on local species richness by conducting a categorical meta-analysis. We reviewed 287 published studies containing 1008 comparisons of species richness in managed and unmanaged forests and derived management, taxon, and continent specific effect sizes. We show that in terms of local species richness loss, forest management types can be ranked, from best to worse, as follows: selection and retention systems, reduced impact logging, conventional selective logging, clear-cutting, agroforestry, timber plantations, fuelwood plantations. Next, we calculated the economic profitability in terms of the net present value of timber harvesting from 10 hypothetical wood-producing Forest Management Units (FMU) from around the globe. The ranking of management types is altered when the species loss per unit profit generated from the FMU is considered. This is due to differences in yield, timber species prices, rotation cycle length and production costs. We thus conclude that it would be erroneous to dismiss or prioritize timber production regimes, based solely on their ranking of alpha diversity impacts.},

   abstract = {The introduction of modern forwarders to Apennines forest operations must account for the traditional forwarding units used by local logging contractors. They generally use the same machine for extraction and intermediate off-road transportation on mountain trails, inaccessible to heavy road vehicles. Conventional forwarders are not designed for fast transportation on trail and cannot replace conventional. This research set up a long-term follow-up study to determine the use pattern of three conventional tractor-trailer units (Forwarder, forestry trailer and articulated truck). The goal of this study was to gauge the potential of these machines. In particular, the study determined for both machine types: monthly usage, incidence of travelling time over total time, distance covered and travel speed. The null hypothesis was that use pattern, average travel distance and speed distribution did not differ between traditional tractor and trailer units and high-speed forwarders. For this purpose, Global Positioning System/Global System for Mobile Communications data loggers were installed for continuous real-time collection of the main work data, including position, status, speed and fuel consumption. The study showed that new forwarders could actually travel at a speed higher than 24 km h −1 , and they performed both extraction and intermediate transportation. They were capable of independent relocation, which made them suitable for small-scale forestry. Both machine types were used intensively, but the annual usage of forwarders was almost twice as large as that of tractor-trailer units. Furthermore, forwarders had a 27% higher hourly productivity and a 50% higher fuel consumption per hour, compared with tractor-trailer units.},

Studies are needed to improve the understanding of the effect of the extent and position along the watershed of restored areas on soil and water conservation. This study aimed to understand how different restoration strategies might reflect in soil conservation and sediment retention. Using InVEST tool, sediment transport was simulated in a small 12 km2 watershed (Posses River, in Southeast Brazil), where one of first Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) projects is being carried out, comparing different hypothetical restoration strategies. With 25% of restoration, sediment export decreased by 78% for riparian restoration, and 27% for the steepest slopes restoration. On the other hand, the decrease in soil loss was lower for riparian restoration, with a 16% decrease, while the steepest slopes restoration reduced it by 21%. This mismatch between the reduction of sediment export and soil loss was explained by the fact that forest not only reduces soil loss locally but also traps sediment arriving from the upper parts of the watershed. While the first mechanism is important to provide soil stability, decreasing the risk of landslip, and to maintain agricultural productivity, the second can improve water quality and decrease the risk of silting, with positive effects on the water reservoirs at the outlet of the watershed. This suggests that Riparian and the Steepest Slopes restoration strategies are complementary in the sense of preventing sediments from reaching the water bodies as well as protecting them at their origin (with the reduction of erosion), so it will be advisable to consider the two types of restoration.},

Insight into the presence and strength of response shift effects is necessary for a valid interpretation of change. Study Design and Setting When response shift is investigated through structural equation modeling (SEM), observed change can be decomposed into change because of recalibration response shift, change because of reprioritization and/or reconceptualization response shift, and change because of change in the construct of interest. Subsequently, calculating effect-size indices of change enables evaluation and interpretation of the clinical significance of these different types of change. Results Change was investigated in health-related quality of life data from 170 cancer patients, assessed before surgery and 3 months after surgery. Results indicated that patients deteriorated on general physical health and general fitness and improved on general mental health. The decomposition of change showed that the impact of response shift on the assessment of change was small. Conclusion SEM can be used to enable the evaluation and interpretation of the impact of response shift effects on the assessment of change, particularly through calculation of effect-size indices.

The neighborhood effects are confined by provincial borders, but do not diminish as the geographic scope of the neighborhood increases. Moreover, the effects are amplified by regulatory reforms and political cycles that increase the salience of coal mine safety. The findings of neighborhood effects on coal mine deaths are consistent with the logic of relative performance evaluation (RPE) as a mechanism for shaping policy outcomes.},

   abstract = {Background: New evidence on the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture plus usual care (acupuncture) and counselling plus usual care (counselling) for patients with depression suggests the need to investigate the health-related quality of life and costs of these treatments to understand whether they should be considered a good use of limited health resources. Copyright:
Methods and Findings: The cost-effectiveness analyses are based on the Acupuncture, Counselling or Usual care for Depression (ACUDep) trial results. Statistical analyses demonstrate a difference in mean quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and suggest differences in mean costs which are mainly due to the price of the interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to express decision uncertainty. Acupuncture and counselling are found to have higher mean QALYs and costs than usual care. In the base case analysis acupuncture has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £4,560 per additional QALY and is cost-effective with a probability of 0.62 at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Counselling compared with acupuncture is more effective and more costly with an ICER of £71,757 and a probability of being cost-effective of 0.36. A scenario analysis of counselling versus usual care, excluding acupuncture as a comparator, results in an ICER of £7,935 and a probability of 0.91.
Conclusions: Acupuncture is cost-effective compared with counselling or usual care alone, although the ranking of counselling and acupuncture depends on the relative cost of delivering these interventions. For patients in whom acupuncture is unavailable or perhaps inappropriate, counselling has an ICER less than most cost-effectiveness thresholds. However, further research is needed to determine the most cost-effective treatment pathways for depressed patients when the full range of available interventions is considered.},

   abstract = {Background: The evidence on the effect of acupuncture or counseling for depression is not conclusive yet is sufficient to warrant further research. Our aim is to conduct a full-scale RCT to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of acupuncture and counseling compared to usual care alone. We will explore the experiences and perspectives of patients and practitioners.Methods/Design: Randomized controlled trial with three parallel arms: acupuncture plus usual care, counseling plus usual care, and usual care alone, in conjunction with a nested qualitative study using in-depth interviews with purposive samples of trial participants.Participants: Patients aged over 18 years diagnosed with depression or mood disorder by their GP and with a score of 20 or above on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II).Randomization: Computer randomization by York Trials Unit to acupuncture, counseling, and usual care alone in proportions of 2:2:1, respectively, with secure allocation concealment.Interventions: Patients allocated to acupuncture and counseling groups receive the offer of up to 12 weekly sessions. Both interventions allow flexibility to address patient variation, yet are constrained within defined protocols. Acupuncture is based on traditional Chinese medicine and counseling is non-directive within the humanistic tradition.Outcome: The PHQ-9 is the primary outcome measure, collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Also measured is BDI-II, SF-36 Bodily pain subscale, and EQ-5D. Texted mood scores are collected weekly over the first 15 weeks. Health-related resource use is collected over 12 months.Analysis: The sample size target was for 640 participants, calculated for an effect size of 0.32 on the PHQ-9 when comparing acupuncture with counseling given 90% power, 5% significance, and 20% loss to follow-up. Analysis of covariance will be used on an intention-to-treat basis. Thematic analysis will be used for qualitative data. We will compare incremental cost-effectiveness of the three treatment options at 12 months.Discussion: Ethical approval was obtained in October 2009. There were six subsequent protocol amendments, the last of which was approved in January 2012. Recruitment of 755 participants took place over 18 months. Data collection will be completed by June 2012. No interim analyses have been conducted.Trial registration: ISRCTN63787732. © 2012 MacPherson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND There has been an increase in the utilisation of acupuncture in recent years, yet the evidence base is insufficiently well established to be certain about its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Addressing the questions related to the evidence base will reduce uncertainty and help policy- and decision-makers with regard to whether or not wider access is appropriate and provides value for money. AIM Our aim was to establish the most reliable evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic pain by drawing on relevant evidence, including recent high-quality trials, and to develop fresh evidence on acupuncture for depression. To extend the evidence base we synthesised the results of published trials using robust systematic review methodology and conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture for depression. METHODS AND RESULTS We synthesised the evidence from high-quality trials of acupuncture for chronic pain, consisting of musculoskeletal pain related to the neck and low back, osteoarthritis of the knee, and headache and migraine, involving nearly 18,000 patients. In an individual patient data (IPD) pairwise meta-analysis, acupuncture was significantly better than both sham acupuncture (p < 0.001) and usual care (p < 0.001) for all conditions. Using network meta-analyses, we compared acupuncture with other physical therapies for osteoarthritis of the knee. In both an analysis of all available evidence and an analysis of a subset of better-quality trials, using aggregate-level data, we found acupuncture to be one of the more effective therapies. We developed new Bayesian methods for analysing multiple individual patient-level data sets to evaluate heterogeneous continuous outcomes. An accompanying cost-effectiveness analysis found transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to be cost-effective for osteoarthritis at a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year when all trials were synthesised. When the analysis was restricted to trials of higher quality with adequate allocation concealment, acupuncture was cost-effective. In a RCT of acupuncture or counselling compared with usual care for depression, in which half the patients were also experiencing comorbid pain, we found acupuncture and counselling to be clinically effective and acupuncture to be cost-effective. For patients in whom acupuncture is inappropriate or unavailable, counselling is cost-effective. CONCLUSION We have provided the most robust evidence from high-quality trials on acupuncture for chronic pain. The synthesis of high-quality IPD found that acupuncture was more effective than both usual care and sham acupuncture. Acupuncture is one of the more clinically effective physical therapies for osteoarthritis and is also cost-effective if only high-quality trials are analysed. When all trials are analysed, TENS is cost-effective. Promising clinical and economic evidence on acupuncture for depression needs to be extended to other contexts and settings. For the conditions we have investigated, the drawing together of evidence on acupuncture from this programme of research has substantially reduced levels of uncertainty. We have identified directions for further research. Our research also provides a valuable basis for considering the potential role of acupuncture as a referral option in health care and enabling providers and policy-makers to make decisions based on robust sources of evidence.

Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in representative samples of children/adolescents (8-18 years) from the participating countries of the KIDSCREEN project. Mental health was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and HRQOL by means of the KIDSCREEN-10. Socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed using the Family Affluence Scale and parental level of education. The association between health outcomes and SES was analyzed with the regression-based relative index of inequalities (RII) and population attributable risk. Results: A total of 16,210 parent-child pairs were included. The SDQ showed inequalities in mental health according to family level of education in all countries (RII = 1.45; 1.37-1.53). The RII for HRQOL was 2.15 (1.79-2.59) in the whole sample, with less consistent results by age and country. Conclusions: Socioeconomic inequalities in mental health were consistently found across Europe. Future research should clarify the causes of these inequalities and define initiatives which prevent them continuing into adulthood. © 2013 Swiss School of Public Health.},

   abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is the cancer most frequently diagnosed in women worldwide. Even though survival rates are continually increasing, breast cancer is often associated with long-term psychological distress, chronic pain, fatigue and impaired quality of life. Yoga comprises advice for an ethical lifestyle, spiritual practice, physical activity, breathing exercises and meditation. It is a complementary therapy that is commonly recommended for breast cancer-related impairments and has been shown to improve physical and mental health in people with different cancer types. Objectives: To assess effects of yoga on health-related quality of life, mental health and cancer-related symptoms among women with a diagnosis of breast cancer who are receiving active treatment or have completed treatment. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1), Indexing of Indian Medical Journals (IndMED), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and Clinicaltrials.gov on 29 January 2016. We also searched reference lists of identified relevant trials or reviews, as well as conference proceedings of the International Congress on Complementary Medicine Research (ICCMR), the European Congress for Integrative Medicine (ECIM) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials were eligible when they (1) compared yoga interventions versus no therapy or versus any other active therapy in women with a diagnosis of non-metastatic or metastatic breast cancer, and (2) assessed at least one of the primary outcomes on patient-reported instruments, including health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, fatigue or sleep disturbances. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently collected data on methods and results. We expressed outcomes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and conducted random-effects model meta-analyses. We assessed potential risk of publication bias through visual analysis of funnel plot symmetry and heterogeneity between studies by using the Chi2 test and the I2 statistic. We conducted subgroup analyses for current treatment status, time since diagnosis, stage of cancer and type of yoga intervention. Main results: We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants, 23 of which provided data for meta-analysis. Thirteen studies had low risk of selection bias, five studies reported adequate blinding of outcome assessment and 15 studies had low risk of attrition bias. Seventeen studies that compared yoga versus no therapy provided moderate-quality evidence showing that yoga improved health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40; 10 studies, 675 participants), reduced fatigue (pooled SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.20; 11 studies, 883 participants) and reduced sleep disturbances in the short term (pooled SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; six studies, 657 participants). The funnel plot for health-related quality of life was asymmetrical, favouring no therapy, and the funnel plot for fatigue was roughly symmetrical. This hints at overall low risk of publication bias. Yoga did not appear to reduce depression (pooled SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.05; seven studies, 496 participants; low-quality evidence) or anxiety (pooled SMD -0.53, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.04; six studies, 346 participants; very low-quality evidence) in the short term and had no medium-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.42; two studies, 146 participants; low-quality evidence) or fatigue (pooled SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.29; two studies, 146 participants; low-quality evidence). Investigators reported no serious adverse events. Four studies that compared yoga versus psychosocial/educational interventions provided moderate-quality evidence indicating that yoga can reduce depression (pooled SMD -2.29, 95% CI -3.97 to -0.61; four studies, 226 participants), anxiety (pooled SMD -2.21, 95% CI -3.90 to -0.52; three studies, 195 participants) and fatigue (pooled SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.50; two studies, 106 participants) in the short term. Very low-quality evidence showed no short-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.81, 95% CI -0.50 to 2.12; two studies, 153 participants) or sleep disturbances (pooled SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.34; two studies, 119 participants). No trial adequately reported safety-related data. Three studies that compared yoga versus exercise presented very low-quality evidence showing no short-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.23; three studies, 233 participants) or fatigue (pooled SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.25; three studies, 233 participants); no trial provided safety-related data. Authors' conclusions: Moderate-quality evidence supports the recommendation of yoga as a supportive intervention for improving health-related quality of life and reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances when compared with no therapy, as well as for reducing depression, anxiety and fatigue, when compared with psychosocial/educational interventions. Very low-quality evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions and might be used as an alternative to other exercise programmes.},

Methods Relevant articles were searched using different databases, by checking reference lists and contacting experts. We included articles that either compared children with mental disorders to healthy controls/norm values or made such a comparison possible. Results Sixteen out of 4,560 articles met the pre-defined inclusion criteria. These studies revealed that the QOL of children with various mental disorders is compromised across multiple domains. The largest effect sizes were found for psychosocial and family-related domains and for the total QOL score, whereas physical domains generally were less affected. The most important limitations in the existing literature include the lack of study samples drawn from the general population, the failure to use self-ratings, not considering item overlap between measuring QOL and assessing for the presence of a particular mental disorder, and not determining whether the children were receiving medication for their mental disorder. Conclusions Children with mental disorders experience a considerable reduction in QOL across various domains. Research studies that avoid previous limitations are crucial to fill existing knowledge gaps. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

   abstract = {Background: US veterans report lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) relative to the general population. Identifying behavioral factors related to HRQoL that are malleable to change may inform interventions to improve well-being in this vulnerable group. Purpose: The current study sought to characterize HRQoL in a largely male sample of veterans in addictions treatment, both in relation to US norms and in association with five recommended health behavior practices: regularly exercising, managing stress, having good sleep hygiene, consuming fruits and vegetables, and being tobacco free. Methods: We assessed HRQoL with 250 veterans in addictions treatment (96 % male, mean age 53, range 24–77) using scales from four validated measures. Data reduction methods identified two principal components reflecting physical and mental HRQoL. Model testing of HRQoL associations with health behaviors adjusted for relevant demographic and treatment-related covariates. Results: Compared to US norms, the sample had lower HRQoL scores. Better psychological HRQoL was associated with higher subjective social standing, absence of pain or trauma, lower alcohol severity, and monotonically with the sum of health behaviors (all p < 0.05). Specifically, psychological HRQoL was associated with regular exercise, stress management, and sleep hygiene. Regular exercise also related to better physical HRQoL. The models explained >40 % of the variance in HRQoL. Conclusions: Exercise, sleep hygiene, and stress management are strongly associated with HRQoL among veterans in addictions treatment. Future research is needed to test the effect of interventions for improving well-being in this high-risk group.},

   abstract = {Forest-driven water and energy cycles are poorly integrated into regional, national, continental and global decision-making on climate change adaptation, mitigation, land use and water management. This constrains humanity's ability to protect our planet's climate and life-sustaining functions. The substantial body of research we review reveals that forest, water and energy interactions provide the foundations for carbon storage, for cooling terrestrial surfaces and for distributing water resources. Forests and trees must be recognized as prime regulators within the water, energy and carbon cycles. If these functions are ignored, planners will be unable to assess, adapt to or mitigate the impacts of changing land cover and climate. Our call to action targets a reversal of paradigms, from a carbon-centric model to one that treats the hydrologic and climate-cooling effects of trees and forests as the first order of priority. For reasons of sustainability, carbon storage must remain a secondary, though valuable, by-product. The effects of tree cover on climate at local, regional and continental scales offer benefits that demand wider recognition. The forest- and tree-centered research insights we review and analyze provide a knowledge-base for improving plans, policies and actions. Our understanding of how trees and forests influence water, energy and carbon cycles has important implications, both for the structure of planning, management and governance institutions, as well as for how trees and forests might be used to improve sustainability, adaptation and mitigation efforts.},

   abstract = {A sophisticated method for monitoring land-cover change in a highly disturbed landscape involved change vector analysis of multitemporal Kauth-Thomas transformation data. Landsat TM data acquired after the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens (1986 and 1996) were analyzed in this study. Topographic effects from the rugged terrain were removed by regressing a generated hillshade image against each band to estimate illumination variation. The estimates were subtracted from each image to generate variation-free data. The images were then transformed into Kauth-Thomas features representing brightness and greenness to enhance landscape features and reduce data redundancy. Change vector analysis allowed for land-change classification without defined calibration sites. The technique produced images of change direction and magnitude between two dates based on the inputs of brightness and greenness. The direction of change indicated whether a landscape had experienced deforestation, reforestation, or remained persistent. Magnitude indicated to what degree the change occurred. The results of the study show that intensive vegetation regeneration occurred within the blast-zone between 1986 and 1996. The method provided a clear-cut process for classifying and quantifying vegetation change.},

   abstract = {Background: New evidence on the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture plus usual care (acupuncture) and counselling plus usual care (counselling) for patients with depression suggests the need to investigate the health-related quality of life and costs of these treatments to understand whether they should be considered a good use of limited health resources. Copyright:
Methods and Findings: The cost-effectiveness analyses are based on the Acupuncture, Counselling or Usual care for Depression (ACUDep) trial results. Statistical analyses demonstrate a difference in mean quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and suggest differences in mean costs which are mainly due to the price of the interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to express decision uncertainty. Acupuncture and counselling are found to have higher mean QALYs and costs than usual care. In the base case analysis acupuncture has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £4,560 per additional QALY and is cost-effective with a probability of 0.62 at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Counselling compared with acupuncture is more effective and more costly with an ICER of £71,757 and a probability of being cost-effective of 0.36. A scenario analysis of counselling versus usual care, excluding acupuncture as a comparator, results in an ICER of £7,935 and a probability of 0.91.
Conclusions: Acupuncture is cost-effective compared with counselling or usual care alone, although the ranking of counselling and acupuncture depends on the relative cost of delivering these interventions. For patients in whom acupuncture is unavailable or perhaps inappropriate, counselling has an ICER less than most cost-effectiveness thresholds. However, further research is needed to determine the most cost-effective treatment pathways for depressed patients when the full range of available interventions is considered.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To establish the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. Control group intervention, blinding of treatment, outcome measures and the acceptability of such a trial amongst participants were key factors to be addressed. The findings from this study will be used to determine the design of a phase III randomised controlled trial. Design: Nineteen participants were recruited through general practices in London, UK. Participants were randomly assigned on a 2:1 basis to either 12 sessions of verum acupuncture or 12 sessions of sham acupuncture (control). Sham acupuncture involved actual needling but at sites considered to be unrelated to depression. Main outcome measures: The Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) and the RAND 36 Item Health Survey 1.0 (RAND) were completed at baseline and at the end of treatment or at treatment dropout. All participants also attended a brief qualitative interview at the end of the study. Results: Treatment dropout was low and there were high levels of patient enthusiasm for a study of acupuncture. Referrals from General Practitioners (GPs) were lower than expected. The sham control method successfully maintained participant blinding to treatment and enabled the specific (or active) component of an acupuncture intervention to be isolated and its efficacy assessed. The outcome measures were sensitive enough to record changes in depressive symptoms and quality of life and are appropriate for use in a larger trial. Conclusions: This feasibility study has provided important information that can be used to guide the design and methodology of a full-randomised controlled trial. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {As payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs grow around the world, so have concerns over whether a focus on ecosystem services will also protect biodiversity. Biodiverse Ecuadorian páramo grasslands have become a hotspot for PES in an effort to protect water supplies, sequester carbon, conserve biodiversity, and improve rural livelihoods. However, the outcomes of PES-incentivized land management, particularly burn exclusion, on plant communities and their associated ecosystem services remain poorly understood. To address this science-policy gap, we evaluated plant richness and number and cover of the ten major páramo growth forms in two study areas with chronosequences of burn exclusion. Both species richness and number of growth forms was highest in sites with intermediate times-since-last burn and the cover of tussock grasses—critical to protecting soils and maintaining hydrologic function—recovered within 3–6 years after fire at both study areas, suggesting that PES programs targeting hydrologic services do not need to exclude burning to ensure adequate vegetation cover over the long-term. However, shrub growth forms were slower to recover, indicating that conserving the plant composition characteristic of less disturbed páramos requires some protection from burning. Findings provide broad lessons for PES programs focused on both biodiversity and ecosystem services and point to the importance of clearly defining PES ecological goals since land-use prescriptions may differ depending on the management objective.},

To identify why the social approach remains unclear, we reviewed current trends in the literature. We found two main reasons: (i) the cultural ecosystem services are usually used to represent the whole social approach, and (ii) the economic valuation based on social preferences is typically included in the social approach. Next, we proposed a framework for the social valuation of ecosystem services that provides alternatives to economics methods, enables comparison across studies, and supports decision-making in land planning and management. The framework includes the agreements emerged from the review, such as considering spatial–temporal flows, including stakeholders from all social ranges, and using two complementary methods to value ecosystem services. Finally, we provided practical recommendations learned from the application of the proposed framework in a case study.},

   abstract = {The degradation of ecosystems, including forests, and the associated loss of biodiversity, particularly due to human-induced threats and climate change, has gained increased attention from scientists and policymakers. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment presented a new conceptual framework that puts ecosystem services at the centre and links human well-being to the impacts on ecosystems of changes in natural resources. The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity initiative drew further attention to the economic benefits of conserving ecosystems and biodiversity, supporting the idea that economic instruments – if appropriately applied, developed and interpreted – can inform policy- and decision-making processes. Only a few ecosystem services, however, have explicit market value and are traded in open markets: many – especially those categorized as having “passive-use” value – remain invisible and are rarely accounted for in traditional economic systems. The failure to appropriately consider the full economic value of ecosystem services in decision making enables the continued degradation and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. Most ecosystem services are considered public goods and tend to be overexploited by society. Many methods have been applied to the economic valuation of ecosystem services. The use of these methods, as well as the interpretation of their results, requires familiarity with the ecological, political, normative and socio-economic context and the science of economics. Recognizing, demonstrating and capturing the value of ecosystem services can play an important role in setting policy directions for ecosystem management and conservation and thus in increasing the provision of ecosystem services and their contributions to human well-being. The aim of this manual is to enhance understanding of ecosystem services and their valuation. The specific target group comprises governmental officers in planning units and field-level officers and practitioners in key government departments in Bangladesh responsible for project development, including the Ministry of Environment and Forests and its agencies. Most of the examples and case studies presented herein, therefore, are tailored to the Bangladesh context, but the general concepts, approaches and methods can be applied to a broad spectrum of situations. This manual focuses on valuing forest-related ecosystem services, including those provided by trees outside forests. It is expected to improve valuation efforts and help ensure the better use of such values in policymaking and decision making. Among other things, the manual explores the basics of financial mathematics (e.g. the time value of money; discounting; cost–benefit analysis; and profitability and risk indicators); the main methods of economic valuation; examples of the valuation of selected ecosystem services; and inputs for considering values in decision making.},

   abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems in the tropical Andes are under increasing pressure from human modification of the landscape (deforestation and dams) and climatic change (increase of extreme events and 1.5 °C on average temperatures are projected for AD 2100). However, the resilience of these ecosystems to perturbations is poorly understood. Here we use a multi-proxy palaeoecological approach to assess the response of aquatic ecosystems to a major mechanism for natural disturbance, volcanic ash deposition. Specifically, we present data from two Neotropical lakes located on the eastern Andean flank of Ecuador. Laguna Pindo (1°27.132′S–78°04.847′W) is a tectonically formed closed basin surrounded by a dense mid-elevation forest, whereas Laguna Baños (0°19.328′S–78°09.175′W) is a glacially formed lake with an inflow and outflow in high Andean Páramo grasslands. In each lake we examined the dynamics of chironomids and other aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms to explore the effect of thick (> 5 cm) volcanic deposits on the aquatic communities in these two systems with different catchment features. In both lakes past volcanic ash deposition was evident from four large tephras dated to c.850 cal year BP (Pindo), and 4600, 3600 and 1500 cal year BP (Baños). Examination of the chironomid and aquatic assemblages before and after the ash depositions revealed no shift in composition at Pindo, but a major change at Baños occurred after the last event around 1500 cal year BP. Chironomids at Baños changed from an assemblage dominated by Pseudochironomus and Polypedilum nubifer-type to Cricotopus/Paratrichocladius type-II, and such a dominance lasted for approximately 380 years. We suggest that, despite potential changes in the water chemistry, the major effect on the chironomid community resulted from the thickness of the tephra being deposited, which acted to shallow the water body beyond a depth threshold. Changes in the aquatic flora and fauna at the base of the trophic chain can promote cascade effects that may deteriorate the ecosystem, especially when already influenced by human activities, such as deforestation and dams, which is frequent in the high Andes.},

   abstract = {The application of payment for ecosystem services schemes to dryland areas has been limited, particularly for schemes that seek to improve the grassland upon which resource users in these landscapes depend. The high levels of climatic and resource variability, strength of informal institutions governing resource use and contested nature of resource decline are examples of defining characteristics that may challenge the application of more conventional payment for ecosystem services schemes in dryland contexts. We used a social–ecological systems framework to (i) help identify design criteria for effective and efficient payment for ecosystem services schemes in drylands under a pastoral land-use, and (ii) explore the applicability of the framework to dryland areas. Using eco-compensation schemes in the Chinese governed areas of the Eurasian steppe as a case study, we found that the framework adequately identified the need for non-equilibrium dynamics to be incorporated into scheme design. However, the framework was less able to explicitly enunciate the importance of micro-economics and cultural values for scheme viability. In contexts like the Eurasian steppe where some level of grazing may maximise the species richness of grasslands, acknowledging history of use in the resource unit subsystem component of the framework, not just the user subsystem component, would improve the framework. The explicit incorporation of contested issues into the framework is also needed, as dryland areas have a history of being misunderstood by non-dryland cultures, researchers and policymakers. We conclude that tailoring a general diagnostic tool towards the specific social–ecological attributes of the drylands under a pastoral land-use will improve the ability of payment for ecosystem services schemes to reach their conservation aims.},

   abstract = {Identification and assessment of socio-cultural values of ecosystem services are increasingly important for the planning and management of forest resources. Key information necessary is how different forest user groups perceive and prioritize different ecosystem services based on their local setting. We assessed the socio-cultural values of ecosystem services of high-altitude oak forests in Western Bhutan using participatory approaches with two important forest users: local communities and forest experts. We found that these forests serve as a pool of 22 ecosystem services under four MEA categories of provisioning (9), regulating (8), supporting (2), and cultural (3) services. Fresh water was unanimously identified as the most valuable service, as well as the most vulnerable, by both the groups. The priorities of local communities inclined towards provisioning and cultural services due to their dependence on these services for their livelihood and wellbeing. Forest experts' priorities were more evenly spread over three categories of services: provisioning, regulating, and supporting services, reflecting their broader interest in resource management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation. Several regulating and supporting services were not easily identified by many villagers, suggesting that bridging the priorities of local interests with broader national forestry goals may require public partnerships and integrated decision-making about the entire suite of ecosystem services. Several management interventions proposed by the groups were presented for consideration by local users, scientists, and policy makers. For all ongoing and future ecosystem service assessments, we recommend the integration of socio-cultural values with biophysical and monetary assessments to fully value the benefits from the high-altitude oak forests.},

Policies dealing with a broad range of forest issues are often based on definitions created for the purpose of assessing global forest stocks, which do not distinguish between natural and planted forests or reforests, and which have not proved useful in assessing national and global rates of forest regrowth and restoration. Implementing and monitoring forest and landscape restoration requires additional approaches to defining and assessing forests that reveal the qualities and trajectories of forest patches in a spatially and temporally dynamic landscape matrix. New technologies and participatory assessment of forest states and trajectories offer the potential to operationalize such definitions. Purpose-built and contextualized definitions are needed to support policies that successfully protect, sustain, and regrow forests at national and global scales. We provide a framework to illustrate how different management objectives drive the relative importance of different aspects of forest state, dynamics, and landscape context.},

   abstract = {Tropical forests are crucial in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem services, but at the same time, they are major sources of revenue and provide livelihoods for forest-dependent people. Hopes for the simultaneous achievement of conservation goals and poverty alleviation are therefore increasingly placed on forests used for timber extraction. Most timber exploitation is carried out unsustainably, which causes forest degradation. Two important mechanisms have emerged to promote sustainable forest management: certification and community-based forest management (CFM). We synthesize the published information about how forest certification and CFM perform in terms of environmental, social, and economic variables. With the caveat that very few published studies meet the standards for formal impact evaluation, we found that certification has substantial environmental benefits, typically achieved at a cost of reduced short-term financial profit, and accompanied by some improvement to the welfare of neighboring communities. We found that the economic and environmental benefits of CFM are understudied, but that the social impacts are controversial, with both positive and negative changes reported. We identify the trade-offs that likely caused these conflicting results and that, if addressed, would help both CFM and certification deliver the hoped-for benefits.},

   abstract = {Magazine R1119 planned logging road networks, directional felling and winching, all of which are key components of reduced-impact logging (Supplemental information) [5]. Consequently, reduced-impact logging improves forest sustainability and ecosystem-service provision [6,7]. Indeed, the adoption of reduced-impact logging across production forests globally would cut carbon emissions by an estimated 160 million tonnes per year, equivalent to ca. 10 percent of carbon emissions from deforestation [8]. While reduced-impact logging has received growing attention (Supplemental information), few studies have directly compared the biodiversity impacts of this selective logging practice with those of conventional selective logging, making it difficult to build a strong evidence-base to inform conservation management and forestry policy. Here, we address this knowledge gap via a pan-tropical meta-analysis that utilises species abundance information to examine the relative consequences of contrasting logging regimes. All available logging effect studies that compared primary tropical forest with conventional logging and/ or reduced-impact logging forests were included in our analyses, amounting to 3474 comparisons from 41 studies (Supplemental Information). Tropical ecologists have reported both increases and decreases in diversity in response to selective logging at almost equal frequency [2], so we assess assemblage change to better account for shifts in the balance between generalist and specialist species that are expected following disturbance. Our analyses reveal the effects of reduced-impact logging to be consistently lower than those of conventional logging, with smaller shifts in species abundance under reduced-impact logging (mean Hedge's g ± 95% CI: conventional logging = 0.476 ± 0.03; reduced-impact logging = 0.393 ± 0.05; Figure 1). This finding could be attributed to differences in harvest intensity, logging practices, or both. To control for intensity, we repeated effect size calculations to include only those conventional-logging studies with comparable harvest levels to those of reduced-impact logging (≤30 m 3 ha-1), and the pattern remained the same (Figure 1). Considering different taxonomic groups separately, our dataset revealed smaller detrimental effects under reduced-impact logging},

   abstract = {Primary tropical forests are lost at an alarming rate, and much of the remaining forest is being degraded by selective logging [1-5]. Yet, the impacts of logging on biodiversity remain poorly understood, in part due to the seemingly conflicting findings of case studies: about as many studies have reported increases in biodiversity after selective logging as have reported decreases [2, 6-11]. Consequently, meta-analytical studies that treat selective logging as a uniform land use tend to conclude that logging has negligible effects on biodiversity [2, 6, 12]. However, selectively logged forests might not all be the same [2, 13-15]. Through a pantropical meta-analysis and using an information-theoretic approach, we compared and tested alternative hypotheses for key predictors of the richness of tropical forest fauna in logged forest. We found that the species richness of invertebrates, amphibians, and mammals decreases as logging intensity increases and that this effect varies with taxonomic group and continental location. In particular, mammals and amphibians would suffer a halving of species richness at logging intensities of 38 m 3 ha-1 and 63 m3 ha-1, respectively. Birds exhibit an opposing trend as their total species richness increases with logging intensity. An analysis of forest bird species, however, suggests that this pattern is largely due to an influx of habitat generalists into heavily logged areas while forest specialist species decline. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the nuanced responses of species along a gradient of logging intensity, which could help inform evidence-based sustainable logging practices from the perspective of biodiversity conservation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The forest certification process in Guatemala has largely been confined to the forest concessions in the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR), representing 95 percent of the country?s certified forest area. Forest certification in Guatemala is unique in that certification in accordance with the scheme of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is mandatory in order for both communities and industrial groups to obtain and maintain forest concessions in the MBR. Unlike other countries where forest certification has almost exclusively been advanced in a joint effort between non- governmental organizations, development projects and the private sector, the case of Guatemala shows the important role government agencies can play as agents backing the process. Despite initial resistance, the National Council for Protected Areas (CONAP), as the state agency in charge of the Maya Biosphere Reserve in the Pet�n region of northern Guatemala, permitted forest management in the MBR provided that it was subject to FSC certification. Sixteen forest management units covering close to half a million hectares of broadleaved forests have since been certified, including 10 community concessions, four cooperatives or municipal ejidos and two industrial concessions. In addition, two forest plantations outside the MBR have been certified. Notwithstanding the considerable progress towards sustainable forest management in the MBR, economic benefits as returns on certification investments have generally not lived up to expectations. Moreover, forest certification has yet to gain momentum outside the Maya Biosphere Reserve where the process is voluntary. Increasing the benefits of certification and expanding its coverage would require a concerted effort between the various stakeholders involved, thorough cost-benefit analysis in each individual case, and the development of integrated supply chains of certified forest products. Toward this end, we suggest creating learning alliances between key actors in the certification process, such as managers from certified management units and processing plants, non-governmental and governmental organizations, certification and accreditation bodies, donor agencies, research institutions, and business development service providers.},

   abstract = {Over 400 million hectares of tropical forest are currently designated as logging concessions. This practice is an important source of timber, but there are concerns about its long-term sustainability and impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. However, logging impacts vary widely, making generalisation and, consequently, policy implementation, difficult. Recent syntheses of animal biodiversity have indicated that differences in logging intensity - the volume of wood removed ha-1 - might help to explain some of these disparities. In addition, it has widely been assumed that reduced impact logging (RIL) might minimise some of the negative effects of logging; though in practice, this has rarely been tested. To test the hypothesis that RIL reduces negative impacts of selective logging once intensity is controlled for, we used meta-analyses of selective logging impact studies, focusing specifically on (1) residual tree damage, (2) aboveground biomass and (3) tree species richness. Our results indicate that RIL appears to reduce residual tree damage when compared to conventional methods. However, changes in aboveground biomass were negatively related to logging intensity. Any effect of RIL, independent of logging intensity, was difficult to discern since it was carried out at relatively low intensities. Tree richness appeared to increase at low intensities but decreased at higher intensities and any effect of RIL was difficult to detect. Our results tentatively support the hypothesis that RIL reduces the negative impacts of logging on tree damage, but do not support suggestions that RIL reduces loss of aboveground biomass or tree species richness. However, this lack of support may be a result of the relative paucity of data on the topic. Based on our results, we suggest that better evidence is needed to assess the differences between the impacts of RIL and conventional logging. Studies that consider plot-level differences in logging intensity are required to fill this knowledge gap. In addition, there must be clarification of whether RIL is an inherently low intensity practice so that this can be factored into management.},

Based upon fieldwork in four Bolivian CFOs and more than 140 interviews, this paper identifies some of the major constraints on community forestry certification in Bolivia. The findings suggest that the present conditions in the studied CFOs are jeopardizing FSC certification and its ability to yield a positive financial cost-benefit balance in the long term. In contrary to what is generally being assumed by Bolivian FSC experts and stakeholders, this study suggests that the recent tendency to form certified community-company alliances, as an alternative to existing approaches, might not (yet) be able to deliver much direct economic benefits to the communities.},

First the paper reviews the development of community-based forest management and the evolution in certification of community-based forest enterprises. Next it discusses the main challenges and opportunities for making CFE certification accessible and beneficial for communities. Finally it illustrates the importance of multi-level and multi-actor partnerships for creating effective interfaces between global standards and community forestry practices. The experiences with FSC certification of community-based forest enterprises demonstrate that community forestry is enlarging its scope from autonomous decision-making on local practice to incorporation in international forest governance systems. This experience also demonstrates that the application of global standards for sustainable forest management requires adaptation to local realities. These lessons are of relevance for further incorporation of community forestry in the newly evolving global programs for forest management and conservation. © 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.},

This study evaluates the profitability of three CFEs in the Brazilian Amazon: Ambé, an industrial-scale, upland forest operation producing logs in a national forest, in Pará state; ACAF, a small-scale operation in flooded forests producing boards with a portable sawmill in Amazonas state; and Mamirauá, one of 30 CFEs in a reserve in Amazonas state producing logs and boards in flooded forests. Costs for each CFE were compiled by forest management activity and cost type. Annual total costs were calculated as the sum of fixed and variable costs and then subtracted from total revenue to obtain annual profit. The annual rate of return on investment was calculated by dividing profits by total costs. The Ambé and Mamirauá cases were profitable, demonstrating rates of return of approximately 12% and 2%, respectively; the ACAF case was not profitable. This study illustrates the benefits of cost-sharing among CFEs, and the potential return for investments in small and large-scale community forestry. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

As of 2003, 50 communities worldwide have received forest management certificates or chain of custody certification, and many other forest communities have been brought into the decision-making process of the certification of public and private forests as stakeholders. A rich set of lessons can be learned from their experiences that can help guide all certification schemes with an interest in community forest management. In essence, certification has benefited communities in many ways. Yet high costs, standard procedures and requirements as well as policy and regulatory constraints have precluded a large number of communities from beginning the process of certification. Going forward, the standards of certification schemes need to be reviewed and the standard-setting dialogue opened to include community clients (either by modifying the rules or creating a dual track). In parallel, alternative models of certifying sustainability should be considered.},

We cannot detect an effect, on average, of CFM compared to no CFM, even when we restricted the sample to only where information suggests effective CFM implementation on the ground. Likewise, we cannot detect an effect of CFM where commercial use of natural resources is allowed. However, we can detect a reduction in deforestation in CFM that does not permit commercial uses, compared to no CFM or CFM allowing commercial uses.

   abstract = {Objectives: The short form or s-allele variant of the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), as compared with the long-form or l-allele variant, has been associated with the presence of cognitive dysfunction, and particularly memory impairment in older adults. This body of cross-sectional work has culminated in the hypothesis that presence of the s-allele predicts greater memory decline in older adults. Yet, to date, there are no longitudinal studies that have investigated this issue. Methods/Design: Here, we examine 109 community-dwelling older adults (mean and SD of age = 70.7 ± 8.7 years) who underwent blood draw for genotyping, cognitive, and psychological testing at baseline, 12-, and 24-monthfollow-ups. Results: Multilevel modeling found that s-allele carriers (ss or ls) performed worse than ll homozygotes at baseline on delayed verbal recall. Yet, s-allele carriers' memory performance was stable over the two-yearfollow-up period, while l-allele homozygotes experienced significant memory decline. l-allele homozygote status was associated with both increased cortisol and decreased memory over time, resulting in attenuated verbal memory performance differences compared to s-allele carriers with age. Conclusions: Overall, our findings do not support the hypothesis that presence of the 5-HTTLPRs-allele is a marker for memory decline in older adults. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:-, 2020.},

The pandemic has likely exacerbated opioid use problems among Indigenous communities, especially for individuals with acute distress or comorbid mental illness, or who are in need of withdrawal management or residential services. In response to the pandemic, we discuss first how greater prescription flexibility has facilitated and even increased access to medications for opioid use disorder. Second, we describe how Indigenous-serving clinics have expanded telemedicine services, albeit not without some challenges. Third, we note challenges with restricted participation in traditional Indigenous healing practices that can be helpful for addiction recovery. Fourth, we mention providers' worries about the pandemic's impact on their patients' mental health and safety. We argue that certain treatment transformations may be helpful even after the pandemic is over, through enhancing access to community-grounded treatment, decreasing stigma, and promoting patient self-efficacy.},

   abstract = {Objective: To investigate the outcomes of resilience training (RT) in an outpatient clinical setting on symptom relief for current or recurrent depression, as well as perceived stress and state and trait anxiety. Design: Observational effectiveness study. Settings/Location: Penny George Institute for Health and Healing, Allina Health, Minneapolis, MN. Participants: A total of 728 men and women age 18 years and older who participated in the RT program between December 1, 2007, and November 31, 2012. Of these individuals, 371 were considered study contributors and completed at least one questionnaire both before (pre-RT) and after (post-RT) completion of the program. The remaining participants were considered study non-contributors and did not complete any questionnaires. Interventions: RT is a mindfulness-based program that synergizes elements of mindfulness meditation with nutrition and exercise into a cohesive intervention. Outcome measures: Depressive symptoms, as well as state and trait anxiety and perceived stress. Results: Among the 371 RT participant contributors, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and state and trait anxiety improved significantly from pre-RT to post-RT. Furthermore, among participants with depression at baseline, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-10 scores decreased by a mean of 44.0% (from 17.5 to 9.8), a value below the cutoff for significant depressive symptoms. Baseline perceived stress scores were the most predictive of program success. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that a multimodal RT program delivered in a real-world clinical setting improves symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Limitations of this effectiveness study include a homogeneous population of mostly white women and a large amount of randomized, imputed, and missing data. Future work should include a randomized controlled trial and potentially studies to separate RT into the three components to determine which may be primarily responsible for the improved outcomes.},

   abstract = {Background: The findings of trials investigating the effects of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) supplementation on depression, anxiety, and C-reactive protein (CRP) are inconsistent. The current meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out to assess the effects of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) administration on mental health parameters and CRP levels. Methods: Two independent authors systematically searched online databases including EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception until 30th July 2019. Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was applied to assess the methodological quality of included trials. The heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using Cochrane's Q test and I-square (I2) statistic. Data were pooled using a random-effects model and weighted mean difference (WMD) was considered as the overall effect size. Results: Twenty one trials were included in this meta-analysis. Consumption of saffron resulted in a significant reduction in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (11 studies with 12 effect size) (WMD: −4.86; 95 % CI: −6.58, −3.14), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (5 studies) (WMD: −5.29; 95 % CI: −8.27, −2.31) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (3 studies with 4 effect size) (WMD: −2.22; 95 % CI: −2.73, −1.72). Saffron intake did not affect Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS-A) scores and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrated that saffron intake significantly reduced BDI, BAI and PSQI scores, but did not affect HDRS-D, HARS-A scores and CRP levels.},

   abstract = {Background: Mindful2Work is a 6-week program combining physical activity, yoga and mindfulness meditations, targeting (work-related) stress complaints from a body-mind perspective. Materials and methods: We combined a top-down approach (researcher-driven outcome measures) with a bottom-up approach (personal goals and interview data) to investigate the effects on 98 employees with at least moderate (work-related) stress. Effects on personal goals, well-being (stress, anxiety, depression, sleep, affect, happiness), functioning at work (dropout, mental and physical workability, work satisfaction), and training-specific aspects (mindful awareness, self-compassion, emotion regulation strategies) were assessed. Results: Nearly all measures showed no change during the wait-list period, with only negative affect and physical workability showing small statistically significant improvements. Medium to large effect size improvements directly after training and at all follow-ups were found on primary outcomes stress (0.62–1.17), and risk for dropout from work (0.55–1.00), and largest effects occurred on personal goals (0.98–1.46). Improvements in well-being and functioning at work were medium directly after training, and at follow-up 1 (six weeks later) and 2 (six months later), and large at follow-up 3 (one year later). The training-specific measures showed small to medium effects after training and at follow-up 1. Further, from the interviews (n = 9), two main categories of effects emerged: well-being and acquired insights. Conclusion: Mindful2Work showed substantial and long-lasting improvements according to researcher-driven measures as well as participants’ own reports.},

Arts activities have been found to improve depression, but whether people with depression make differential use of emotion regulation strategies (ERSs) when engaging in the arts remains unclear. This study analysed data from 11,248 individuals with depression who were matched on demographics, personality and arts experience with a further 11,248 individuals without depression. We found a significantly lower overall use of self-reported ERSs when engaging in arts amongst those with depression; specifically lower use of approach strategies (e.g. reappraisal) and self-development strategies (e.g. improved self-esteem), but the same use of avoidance strategies (e.g. distraction). However, these differences were very slight (very small effect size and <1% difference). This suggests that people with depression still experience benefits for emotion regulation, which could help to explain the beneficial effects of arts interventions reducing symptoms of depression.},

   abstract = {There is increasing evidence that acupuncture is useful in treating somatic and psychological disorders caused by stress; however, the physiological basis of the effect remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of acupuncture on psychological conditions (i.e., anxiety) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. We studied 10 patients with anxiety disorders and measured anxiety levels by means of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), including state anxiety (STAI-1) and trait anxiety (STAI-2). Employing a two-channel NIRS device, we measured oxy-Hb concentration in the bilateral PFC at rest, and evaluated asymmetry of the PFC activity by calculating the Laterality Index at Rest (LIR). The patients were treated by acupuncture at Yui Clinic in Osaka. The treatment significantly decreased the STAI-1 score (p<0.001), but not the STAI-2 score (p>0.05). The NIRS measurements indicated the presence of spontaneous oscillations of oxy-Hb in the bilateral PFC at rest before and after the treatment. Notably LIR decreased significantly in 7 out of the 10 subjects (p<0.01), while 3 subjects showed an increasing tendency. The present pilot study indicates that acupuncture is effective in decreasing anxiety levels in patients with anxiety disorders. Our NIRS data suggest that acupuncture may alter the balance of PFC activity at rest, resulting in relaxation effects. Our NIRS data suggest that acupuncture changes the balance of PFC activity toward left-dominant, resulting in relaxation effects on the patients.},

However, caring can result in physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual symptoms in providers that can interfere with their capacity to enter into these relationships. PURPOSE:: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether auricular acupuncture is an effective tool for reducing health care provider stress and anxiety and, second, to determine if auricular acupuncture impacts provider capacity for developing caring relationships with patients. METHODS:: Preintervention and postintervention surveys were evaluated to see if auricular acupuncture was associated with changes in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Professional Quality of Life, and Caring Ability Inventory scores. RESULTS:: Compared with baseline, participants had a significant reduction in state anxiety (STAI), trait anxiety (STAI), burnout, and secondary traumatic stress scores (Professional Quality of Life). Significant increases were noted in courage and patience, 2 dimensions of the Caring Ability Inventory. CONCLUSIONS:: Auricular acupuncture is an effective intervention for the relief of stress/anxiety in providers and supports heightened capacity for caring. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health.},

   abstract = {Objective: To evaluate acupuncture as a nonpharmacologic intervention for pain management in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: Adult patients with multiple myeloma undergoing high-dose melphalan chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood HSCT were randomized to receive either true (TA) or sham acupuncture (SA) once daily for five days starting on the day after chemotherapy. Use of pain medications and pain scores were assessed at baseline and at days 5, 15, and 30 after transplantation. Results: Among 60 evaluable subjects, the SA group (vs TA) had greater than five times odds of increasing pain medication use from baseline. Among patients who were opioid nonusers at baseline, all 15 patients in the TA group remained free from opioid use at the end of the study. In contrast, 20% of those in the SA group (four of the 20 patients) started to use opioids after chemotherapy and stem cell infusion (day 5) and 40% (eight of the 20) had become opioid users by day 30 after HSCT (Fisher exact test P = 0.006). Among patients who were taking opioids at baseline, 14% in the TA group vs 10% in the SA group increased opioid intake at day 5, and 21% (TA) vs 30% (SA) at day 30 (P = 0.86). Conclusions: Acupuncture appears to significantly reduce the need for pain medications during HSCT and the number of post-HSCT opioid users among baseline opioid nonusers. It warrants further studies as an opioid-sparing intervention for pain in HSCT patients.},

   abstract = {Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease, which causes serious social and economic problems. The most important trial for the successful treatment of drug addiction is to prevent the high rate of relapse to drug-seeking behaviors. Opponent process as a motivational theory with excessive drug seeking in the negative reinforcement of drug dependence reflects both loss of brain reward system and recruitment of brain stress system. The negative emotional state produced by brain stress system during drug withdrawal might contribute to the intense drug craving and drive drug-seeking behaviors via negative reinforcement mechanisms. Decrease in dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens and recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor in the extended amygdala are hypothesized to be implicated in mediating this motivated behavior. Also, a brain stress response system is hypothesized to increase drug craving and contribute to relapse to drug-seeking behavior during the preoccupation and anticipation stage of dependence caused by the exposure to stress characterized as the nonspecific responses to any demands on the body. Acupuncture has proven to be effective for reducing drug addiction and stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Furthermore, acupuncture has been shown to correct reversible brain malfunctions by regulating drug addiction and stress-related neurotransmitters. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to propose that acupuncture attenuates relapse to drug-seeking behavior through inhibition of stress response. In this review, a brief description of stress in relapse to drug-seeking behavior and the effects of acupuncture were presented.},

   abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the analgesic effect and tolerance profile of acupuncture versus intravenous (IV) titrated morphine in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with renal colic. Materials and methods: A total of 115 patients were randomized into two groups. Patients in the IV titrated-morphine group (n=61) received 0.1 mg/kg morphine every 5 minutes until pain score dropped by at least 50% of its baseline value. Patients in the acupuncture group (n=54) received an acupuncture session of 30 minutes following a prespecified protocol. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to assess pain intensity at baseline and at 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following the start of the treatment protocol. Possible treatment side effects were also recorded. Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups concerning age, sex, or baseline VAS score. From the 10th minute until the end of the intervention, acupuncture was associated with a deeper analgesic effect than titrated morphine (P<0.05 from the 10th minute and over). Analgesia was also faster in the acupuncture group, with time to obtain 50% reduction of baseline VAS of 14 minutes in the acupuncture group versus 28 minutes in the IV titrated-morphine group (P<0.001). Only three patients in the acupuncture group experienced minor side effects versus 42 in the morphine group (P<0.001). No major side effects were observed in this study. Conclusion: In ED patients with renal colic, acupuncture was associated with a much faster and deeper analgesic effect and a better tolerance profile in comparison with titrated IV morphine.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of collaborative care (vs usual care) for treating depression in patients with diabetes and/or coronary heart disease (CHD). Setting: 36 primary care general practices in North West England. Participants: 387 participants completed baseline assessment (collaborative care: 191; usual care: 196) and full or partial 4-month follow-up data were captured for 350 (collaborative care: 170; usual care: 180). 62% of participants were male, 14% were non-white. Participants were aged ≥18 years, listed on a Quality and Outcomes Framework register for CHD and/or type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, with persistent depressive symptoms. Patients with psychosis or type I/II bipolar disorder, actively suicidal, in receipt of services for substance misuse, or already in receipt of psychological therapy for depression were excluded. Intervention: Collaborative care consisted of evidence-based low-intensity psychological treatments, delivered over 3 months and case management by a practice nurse and a Psychological Well Being Practitioner. Outcome measures: As planned, the primary measure of cost-effectiveness was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)). A Markov model was constructed to extrapolate the trial results from short-term to long-term (24 months). Results: The mean cost per participant of collaborative care was £317 (95% CI 284 to 350). Over 24 months, it was estimated that collaborative care was associated with greater healthcare usage costs (net cost £674 (95% CI -30 953 to 38 853)) and QALYs (net QALY gain 0.04 (95% CI -0.46 to 0.54)) than usual care, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of £16 123, and a likelihood of being cost-effective of 0.54 (willingness to pay threshold of £20 000). Conclusions: Collaborative care is a potentially cost-effective long-term treatment for depression in patients with comorbid physical and mental illness. The estimated cost per QALY gained was below the threshold recommended by English decision-makers. Further, long-term primary research is needed to address uncertainty associated with estimates of cost-effectiveness. Trial registration number: ISRCTN80309252; Post-results.},

   abstract = {Background: There is relatively limited knowledge about the practitioners who provide acupuncture treatment within the UK, what conditions patients consult for and the treatment provided. Objectives: To characterise the conditions treated and by whom, to examine characteristics of the treatment and to explore trends over time. Method: A cross-sectional survey of the UK acupuncture practitioners was conducted; 800 practitioners were selected by computer-generated randomisation sequences from the four major UK-based professional associations. Data collected on the practitioners included demographic details, association membership, statutorily regulated status, practice setting, style of acupuncture, diagnostic methods and needle response sought. Practitioners recorded details of their 10 most recent patients, including demographic details, primary reason for consulting and lifestyle advice provided. Results: 330 practitioners responded comprising doctors (29%) physiotherapists (29%), nurses (15%) and independent acupuncturists (27%): 62% were women with median age of 48 years. The majority (68%) practiced in independent settings and 42% practiced within the National Health Service. Patients most commonly consulted for low back, neck, shoulder and knee pain, as well as headaches and migraine. Treatment for infertility by independent acupuncturists was found to have increased fivefold in 10 years. Conclusion: Acupuncture provides a substantial contribution to the healthcare of the UK, with an estimated 4 million sessions provided annually. The primary complaints for which patients consult reflect the growing evidence base on acupuncture for these conditions. These data provide a basis for decision-making regarding policy and practice.},

   abstract = {Background: Although acupuncture is widely used for chronic pain, there remains considerable controversy as to its value. We aimed to determine the effect size of acupuncture for 4 chronic pain conditions: back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for chronic pain in which allocation concealment was determined unambiguously to be adequate. Individual patient data meta-analyses were conducted using data from 29 of 31 eligible RCTs, with a total of 17 922 patients analyzed. Results: In the primary analysis, including all eligible RCTs, acupuncture was superior to both sham and noacupuncture control for each pain condition (P<.001 for all comparisons). After exclusion of an outlying set of RCTs that strongly favored acupuncture, the effect sizes were similar across pain conditions. Patients receiving acupuncture had less pain, with scores that were 0.23 (95% CI, 0.13-0.33), 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07-0.25), and 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07-0.24) SDs lower than sham controls for back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, and chronic headache, respectively; the effect sizes in comparison to noacupuncture controls were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.51-0.58), 0.57 (95% CI, 0.50-0.64), and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.37-0.46) SDs. These results were robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses, including those related to publication bias. Conclusions: Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain and is therefore a reasonable referral option. Significant differences between true and sham acupuncture indicate that acupuncture is more than a placebo. However, these differences are relatively modest, suggesting that factors in addition to the specific effects of needling are important contributors to the therapeutic effects of acupuncture. © 2012 American Medical Association.

   abstract = {The ability to effectively regulate our emotions has been shown to be impaired in people with depression. Arts activities have been found to improve depression, but whether people with depression make differential use of emotion regulation strategies (ERSs) when engaging in the arts remains unclear. This study analysed data from 11,248 individuals with depression who were matched on demographics, personality and arts experience with a further 11,248 individuals without depression. We found a significantly lower overall use of self-reported ERSs when engaging in arts amongst those with depression; specifically lower use of approach strategies (e.g. reappraisal) and self-development strategies (e.g. improved self-esteem), but the same use of avoidance strategies (e.g. distraction). However, these differences were very slight (very small effect size and <1% difference). This suggests that people with depression still experience benefits for emotion regulation, which could help to explain the beneficial effects of arts interventions reducing symptoms of depression.},

Method: OvidMedline, PsychInfo and Embase were searched for studies on the 5th August 2017. The efficacy of the studies was estimated using meta-analyses. Results: Eight RCTs were included. No RCTs were identified for people with MCI. Four RCTs found that psychosocial interventions (multicomponent intervention, Tai Chi, problem adaptation therapy and exercise/walking) were effective at reducing symptoms of depression in PWD who were depressed. One study (Tai Chi) found that these reductions were no longer evident at six-month follow-up. Another study, not included in the meta-analyses, found that pleasant events behaviour therapy and problem solving behaviour therapy improved depression symptoms and this effect remained significant at follow-up. Three RCTs found that psychosocial interventions (music therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) reduced symptoms of anxiety in PWD who were anxious. Evidence from two of these RCTs (music therapy and CBT) showed that these improvements were evident at three to six-month follow-up. Conclusion: The identified psychosocial interventions are effective at reducing symptoms of depression or anxiety in PWD experiencing these symptoms. This review is limited by the quality of studies, small sample sizes and the heterogeneity of the interventions, therefore high quality studies with larger sample sizes are required to test the efficacy of specific interventions such as CBT.},

   abstract = {Aim: This pilot study investigated the use of acupuncture in the treatment of paediatric anxiety. Methods: Children with anxiety, aged 8–16, were randomised to either the acupuncture or waitlist control groups. Anxiety was measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) for children and adolescents with generalised anxiety disorder and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children 2nd Edition (MASC-2) self-rated and parent-rated forms. Results: Twenty participants were enrolled in the study and 19 completed all the questionnaires to be included in the analysis. There were no differences in socio-demographic characteristics at baseline between the two groups. At the second assessment, the mean MASC-parent score for the acupuncture group was significantly lower than the waitlist group (65.6 (SD 15.0) compared to 81.0 (SD 11.9), P = 0.025) with an effect size = 1.13. The pre- and post-treatment comparisons were also significantly lower for both groups in the anxiety measures. In the acupuncture group, MASC-parent (P = 0.008, effect size 0.75) and the HAM-A (P < 0.001, effect size 1.4). In the waitlist group, MASC-self (P = 0.022; effect size 0.4), MASC-parent (P = 0.048; effect size 0.75) and HAM-A (P = 0.007; effect size 1.21). Conclusions: This study provided promising results on the potential use of acupuncture to treat children and adolescents with general anxiety. Future research using a randomised control trial with a sufficient sample size to control for confounders and sham (placebo) comparators is warranted.},

   abstract = {Background: Depression is recognised as a major public health problem that has a substantial impact on individuals and on society. People with depression may consider using complementary therapies such as acupuncture, and an increasing body of research has been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for treatment of individuals with depression. This is the second update of this review. Objectives: To examine the effectiveness and adverse effects of acupuncture for treatment of individuals with depression. To determine: Whether acupuncture is more effective than treatment as usual/no treatment/wait list control for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression. Whether acupuncture is more effective than control acupuncture for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression. Whether acupuncture is more effective than pharmacological therapies for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression. Whether acupuncture plus pharmacological therapy is more effective than pharmacological therapy alone for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression. Whether acupuncture is more effective than psychological therapies for treating and improving quality of life for individuals with depression. Adverse effects of acupuncture compared with treatment as usual/no treatment/wait list control, control acupuncture, pharmacological therapies, and psychological therapies for treatment of individuals with depression. Search methods: We searched the following databases to June 2016: Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group Controlled Trials Register (CCMD-CTR), Korean Studies Information Service System (KISS), DBPIA (Korean article database website), Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, Research Information Service System (RISS), Korea Med, Korean Medical Database (KM base), and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS), as well as several Korean medical journals. Selection criteria: Review criteria called for inclusion of all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing acupuncture versus control acupuncture, no treatment, medication, other structured psychotherapies (cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, or counselling), or standard care. Modes of treatment included acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, and laser acupuncture. Participants included adult men and women with depression diagnosed by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), or Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders Third Edition Revised (CCMD-3-R). If necessary, we used trial authors' definitions of depressive disorder. Data collection and analysis: We performed meta-analyses using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Primary outcomes were reduction in the severity of depression, measured by self-rating scales or by clinician-rated scales, and improvement in depression, defined as remission versus no remission. We assessed evidence quality using the GRADE method. Main results: This review is an update of previous versions and includes 64 studies (7104 participants). Most studies were at high risk of performance bias, at high or unclear risk of detection bias, and at low or unclear risk of selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias, and other bias. Acupuncture versus no treatment/wait list/treatment as usual We found low-quality evidence suggesting that acupuncture (manual and electro-) may moderately reduce the severity of depression by end of treatment (SMD -0.66, 95% CI -1.06 to -0.25, five trials, 488 participants). It is unclear whether data show differences between groups in the risk of adverse events (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.24, one trial, 302 participants; low-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus control acupuncture (invasive, non-invasive sham controls) Acupuncture may be associated with a small reduction in the severity of depression of 1.69 points on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) by end of treatment (95% CI -3.33 to -0.05, 14 trials, 841 participants; low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether data show differences between groups in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.86, five trials, 300 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus medication We found very low-quality evidence suggesting that acupuncture may confer small benefit in reducing the severity of depression by end of treatment (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.05, 31 trials, 3127 participants). Studies show substantial variation resulting from use of different classes of medications and different modes of acupuncture stimulation. Very low-quality evidence suggests lower ratings of adverse events following acupuncture compared with medication alone, as measured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (mean difference (MD) -4.32, 95% CI -7.41 to -1.23, three trials, 481 participants). Acupuncture plus medication versus medication alone We found very low-quality evidence suggesting that acupuncture is highly beneficial in reducing the severity of depression by end of treatment (SMD -1.15, 95% CI -1.63 to -0.66, 11 trials, 775 participants). Studies show substantial variation resulting from use of different modes of acupuncture stimulation. It is unclear whether differences in adverse events are associated with different modes of acupuncture (SMD -1.32, 95% CI -2.86 to 0.23, three trials, 200 participants; very low-quality evidence). Acupuncture versus psychological therapy It is unclear whether data show differences between acupuncture and psychological therapy in the severity of depression by end of treatment (SMD -0.5, 95% CI -1.33 to 0.33, two trials, 497 participants; low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence suggests no differences between groups in rates of adverse events (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.33, one trial, 452 participants). Authors' conclusions: The reduction in severity of depression was less when acupuncture was compared with control acupuncture than when acupuncture was compared with no treatment control, although in both cases, results were rated as providing low-quality evidence. The reduction in severity of depression with acupuncture given alone or in conjunction with medication versus medication alone is uncertain owing to the very low quality of evidence. The effect of acupuncture compared with psychological therapy is unclear. The risk of adverse events with acupuncture is also unclear, as most trials did not report adverse events adequately. Few studies included follow-up periods or assessed important outcomes such as quality of life. High-quality randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to examine the clinical efficacy and acceptability of acupuncture, as well as its effectiveness, compared with acupuncture controls, medication, or psychological therapies.},

The aim of this study is to review the scientific literature in order to analyze the effect produced by cognitive-behavioral programs and meditation strategies on stress, anxiety, and depression in students. A further aim is to identify the determinants of treatment success. The bibliographic search was carried out using Web of Science, specifically in the categories of “Education and Educational Research” and “Psychology”, obtaining a sample of 122 articles published between 2007 and 2018. Studies were included which had a pre-experimental or quasi-experimental design and included pre-test and post-test phases. Following application of inclusion criteria, 34 articles were selected for inclusion in a meta-analysis of the random effects of each variable. This obtained an average effect size of −0.41 for stress, −0.37 for anxiety, and −0.30 for depression. Three moderating variables were analyzed, with significant correlations being found for the type of treatment relating to stress (Q = 11.01, df = 2, p = 0.004, R2 = 0.294) and depression (Q = 6.14, df = 2, p = 0.048; R2 = 0.436). The stage of education of the individuals was also found to impact upon anxiety intervention success (Q = 13.093 df = 2, p = 0.0009, R2 = 0.196). Interventions mainly addressed the importance of meditation strategies, mindfulness programs, and cognitive-behavioral therapy to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in students. This supports the need to increase research at an early age, considering the treatment of mental health as a key factor influencing academic performance and quality of life.},

Setting: General practices in England and Wales. Participants: 401 patients with chronic headache, predominantly migraine. Interventions: Patients were randomly allocated to receive up to 12 acupuncture treatments over three months from appropriately trained physiotherapists, or to usual care alone. Main outcome measure: Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: Total costs during the one year period of the study were on average higher for the acupuncture group (£403; $768; €598) than for controls (£217) because of the acupuncture practitioners' costs. The mean health gain from acupuncture during the one year of the trial was 0.021 quality adjusted life years (QALYs), leading to a base case estimate of £9180 per QALY gained. This result was robust to sensitivity analysis. Cost per QALY dropped substantially when the analysis incorporated likely QALY differences for the years after the trial. Conclusions: Acupuncture for chronic headache improves health related quality of life at a small additional cost; it is relatively cost effective compared with a number of other interventions provided by the NHS.},

   abstract = {The Returning Farmland to Forest Program (RFFP; tuigeng huanlin gongcheng), which compensates farmers for cultivating forest on previously non-forested land, is central among the “ecological construction” programs that have transformed landscapes across China. Under the RFFP, state authorities have redefined large areas of land as afforestation area intended to provide environmental services including erosion control, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity regeneration. Tensions among the program's social and environmental objectives as well as the combination of formal rigidity and practical flexibility manifest in ambiguous forest classifications and tremendous variation in outcomes. The RFFP centers on two forest categorizations: ecological forest, intended to rehabilitate environmental services, and commercial forest, which may provide lesser ecological benefits but delivers more immediate economic benefits to households. RFFP policy documents designate “dual-function species” that can be planted as “forests with a primary goal of ecological service provision which also generate commercial value.” A substantial portion of “ecological forests” are dual landscapes intended to accomplish both environmental and socioeconomic goals. Drawing from cases in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hainan provinces, this paper examines the processes of central policy-making and local implementation through which dual-function forests have proliferated, showing how rural residents have responded to the risks and promises of dual-function forests and exploring implications for rural livelihoods and landscapes. While they might be expected to bring win-win outcomes, the performance of dual-function forests on social and environmental goals depends on how local officials and residents respond to the program. Their proliferation demonstrates tensions inherent in state projects aimed at generating both environmental and economic values from rural landscapes.},

Methods: The present prospective study comprised 804 patients having localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. International Prostate Symptom Score and International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life were recorded preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Two study groups were considered: group 1 included patients with International Prostate Symptom Score ≤7 (mild) and group 2 included patients with International Prostate Symptom Score ≥8 (moderate to severe). Student's t-test and logistic regression were carried out to detect a predictive factor of International Prostate Symptom Score ≤7 at 24 months. Results: The mean International Prostate Symptom Score was 5.58±6.6, 11.12±7.1 and 7.62±6 at baseline, 1 month and 3 months, respectively (P <0.0001). The mean quality of life score showed the same evolution with a significant difference at 1 and 3 months. The mean International Prostate Symptom Score was initially 1.57±1.9 in group 1 and 13.51±5.5 in group 2 (P <0.0001), evolving to 3.41±3.1 and 7.69±5.8 at 24 months (P <0.0001), respectively. The mean quality of life score was significantly different between the groups initially, and at 6 and 12 months with P <0.0001, P = 0.005 and P = 0.02, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression showed that age, prostate volume and preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score were independent predictive factors of International Prostate Symptom Score ≤7 at 24 months (P <0.0001). In group 2, 47 patients (17%) had an International Prostate Symptom Score ≥8 at 24 months, 15 of them (32%) having a QoL score ≥3.

The worldview-related CAM health concepts enable health promotion oriented infection prevention and treatment aimed at strengthening or supporting the self-regulating ability of the human organism to cope with diseases. There is some evidence that the CAM concepts of health (promotion) are in agreement with current conceptualization ofhealth and that doctors who practice both CAM and conventional medicine prescribe less antibiotics, although selection bias of the presented studies cannot be ruled out. There is some evidence that prevention and some treatment strategies are effective and safe. Many CAM treatment strategies are promising but overall lack high quality evidence. <br/><br/>Conclusions. CAM prevention and treatment strategies may contribute to reducing antibiotic use, but more rigorous research is necessary to provide high quality evidence of (cost-)effectiveness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reconstructive procedures are common for the reconstruction of complex facial deformities of skin, soft tissues, bony structures, and functional subunits, such as the nose, lips, and eyelids. However, the results have been unsatisfactory. An innovative approach entailing a single surgical procedure of face allograft transplantation is a viable alternative and gives improved results. METHODS: On Dec 9, 2008, a 45-year-old woman with a history of severe midface trauma underwent near-total face transplantation in which 80% of her face was replaced with a tailored composite tissue allograft. We addressed issues of immunosuppressive therapy, psychological and ethical outcomes, and re-integration of the patient into society. FINDINGS: After the operation, the patient did well physically and psychologically, and tolerated immunosuppression without any major complication. Routine biopsy on day 47 after transplantation showed rejection of graft mucosa; however, a single bolus of corticosteroids reversed rejection. During the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the patient accepted her new face; 6 months after surgery, the functional outcome has been excellent. In contrast to her status before transplantation, the patient can now breathe through her nose, smell, taste, speak intelligibly, eat solid foods, and drink from a cup. INTERPRETATION: We show the feasibility of reconstruction of severely disfigured patients in a single surgical procedure using composite face allotransplantation. Therefore, this should be taken in consideration as an early option for severely disfigured patients. FUNDING: None.},

   abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) was used to characterize the time course of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-LUTS) measured by item-level International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS). The Fisher information content of IPSS items was determined and the power to detect a drug effect using the IRT approach was examined. Data from 403 patients with moderate-to-severe BPH-LUTS in a placebo-controlled phase II trial studying the effect of degarelix over 6 months were used for modeling. Three pharmacometric models were developed: a model for total IPSS, a unidimensional IRT model, and a bidimensional IRT model, the latter separating voiding and storage items. The population-level time course of BPH-LUTS in all models was described by initial improvement followed by worsening. In the unidimensional IRT model, the combined information content of IPSS voiding items represented 72% of the total information content, indicating that the voiding subscore may be more sensitive to changes in BPH-LUTS compared with the storage subscore. The pharmacometric models showed considerably higher power to detect a drug effect compared with a cross-sectional and while-on-treatment analysis of covariance, respectively. Compared with the sample size required to detect a drug effect at 80% power with the total IPSS model, a reduction of 5.9% and 11.7% was obtained with the unidimensional and bidimensional IPSS IRT model, respectively. Pharmacometric IRT analysis of the IPSS within BPH-LUTS may increase the precision and efficiency of treatment effect assessment, albeit to a more limited extent compared with applications in other therapeutic areas.},

The former implies that all items measure a common latent trait, while the latter implies that responses are independent, conditional on respondents’ location on the latent trait. Yet, few tests are truly unidimensional. Unmodeled dimensions may result in test items displaying dependencies, which can lead to misestimated parameters and inflated reliability estimates. In this article, we investigate the dimensionality of interim mathematics tests and evaluate the extent to which modeling minor dimensions in the data change model parameter estimates. We found evidence of minor dimensions, but parameter estimates across models were similar. Our results indicate that minor dimensions outside the primary trait have negligible consequences on parameter estimates. This finding was observed despite the ratio of multidimensional to unidimensional items being above previously recommended thresholds.},

Materials and Methods: We performed factor analysis to assess the psychometric validity of separating the 7 items of the AUA symptom index into filling and voiding subsets. To assess the clinical usefulness of calculating these subscores we correlated them against baseline measurements of symptom interference as well as urodynamic and anatomical measures of disease severity, and used them for predicting the response to medical therapy. Results: Factor analysis confirmed the psychometric validity of separating the AUA symptom index into a 3-item filling and a 4-item voiding subscale. However, calculating filling and voiding subscores did not result in differential correlations with measures of disease interference or severity. It also did not enable us to predict a better symptomatic or uroflowmetry response to medical therapy. Conclusions: Calculating separate filling and voiding subscores of the AUA symptom index is psychometrically valid but not clinically useful.},

   abstract = {Objectives. There is debate about the validity of the clinical distinction between filling and voiding symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We examined empirically the evidence for the existence of these clinical constructs. Methods. We analyzed responses to the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA SI) among men from a large cohort sample (the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, n = 7753) and a subsample with physician-diagnosed BPH (n = 1856). We used factor analysis, which is a data reduction tool that allowed us to determine empirically the relationships among lower urinary tract symptoms thought to be clinically related by pathogenesis, physiology, or treatment response. Results. The results of the factor analysis indicated that responses to the AUA SI items could be grouped into one of two subscales: one describing voiding problems and the other describing filling problems. Analyses of internal consistency reliability indicated that the AUA SI as well as the filling and voiding subscales have sound internal reliability. Conclusions. We found empirical support for the clinical conceptualization of lower urinary tract symptoms into filling and voiding problems. These findings provide support for using the total score on the AUA SI as a reliable measure of overall symptom severity in BPH, as well as for separately summing the voiding and filling items to measure these distinctive types of lower urinary tract symptomatology. Further research is needed to determine whether these symptom groupings better distinguish responses to one treatment type over another. If so, targeting treatment based on the relative severity of voiding and filling symptoms might improve patient outcomes.},

   abstract = {Background: One-carbon metabolism genes are linked to several cancers, but the association with prostate cancer (PCa) is less clear. Studies examining the relationship have not accounted for obesity, a risk factor for advanced PCa and altered methylation patterns. We hypothesized that obesity could moderate the association between one-carbon metabolism genes and PCa outcomes. Methods: We conducted secondary data analyses of the Study of Clinical Outcomes, Risk and Ethnicity. Obesity was included as a primary exposure and modifier (interacting with genetic polymorphisms) in the analytic models. We used logistic regression to determine associations of common one-carbon metabolism genotypes with odds of high stage (T3/T4) and high grade (Gleason score ≥ 7). We used Cox regression to examine associations of genotypes with biochemical recurrence. Results: There were 808 patients (632 White and 176 Black.) Among White men, we observed associations of TCN2_R259P with increased odds of high stage (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.41–1.00), but no significant interactions with obesity. Among Black men, the SCL19A1_61bpdel and CBS_68bpINS variants were associated with high grade (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.39–4.89 and OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.09–0.91, respectively.) Both the CBS_68bpINS and MTHFR_E429A variants interacted with obesity in Black men, where the highest risk for biochemical failure and odds of high grade, respectively, occurred among obese patients with variants. Conclusions: We observed associations of one-carbon metabolism genes with different associations by race. We also observed interactions with obesity related to PCa outcomes in Black men only. Therefore, the involvement of one-carbon metabolism on PCa was dependent upon obesity status for Black men. These novel results could help identify patients that might benefit from effective weight management targeting one-carbon metabolism effects.},

Validation studies were conducted involving a total of 210 BPH patients and 108 control subjects. The final AUA symptom index includes 7 questions covering frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, hesitancy, intermittence, incomplete emptying and urgency. On revalidation, the index was internally consistent (Cronbach's α = 0.86) and the score generated had excellent test-retest reliability (r = 0.92). Scores were highly correlated with subjects’ global ratings of the magnitude of their urinary problem (r = 0.65 to 0.72) and powerfully discriminated between BPH and control subjects (receiver operating characteristic area 0.85). Finally, the index was sensitive to change, with preoperative scores decreasing from a mean of 17.6 to 7.1 by 4 weeks after prostatectomy (p <0.001). The AUA symptom index is clinically sensible, reliable, valid and responsive. It is practical for use in practice and for inclusion in research protocols.},

   abstract = {Background:: Predictors of treatment outcome in major depressive disorder (MDD) could contribute to evidence-based therapeutic choices. Combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy show increased efficacy but higher cost compared with antidepressant pharmacotherapy; baseline predictors of pharmacotherapy resistance could be used to identify patients more likely to benefit from combined treatment. Methods:: We performed a proof-of-principle study of the cost-effectiveness of using previously identified pharmacogenetic and clinical risk factors (PGx-CL-R) of antidepressant resistance or clinical risk factors alone (CL-R) to guide the prescription of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy vs pharmacotherapy. The cost-effectiveness of these two strategies was compared with standard care (ST, pharmacotherapy to all subjects) using a three-year Markov model. Model parameters were literature-based estimates of response to pharmacotherapy and combined treatment, costs (UK National Health System) and benefits (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], one QALY=one year lived in perfect health). Results:: CL-R was more cost-effective than PGx-CL-R: the cost of one-QALY improvement was £2341 for CL-R and £3937 for PGx-CL-R compared to ST. PGx-CL-R had similar or better cost-effectiveness compared to CL-R when 1) the cost of genotyping was £100 per subject or less or 2) the PGx-CL-R test had sensitivity ≥ 0.90 and specificity ≥ 0.85. The cost of one-QALY improvement for CL-R was £3664 and of £4110 in two independent samples. Limitations:: lack of validation in large samples from the general population. Conclusions:: Using clinical risk factors to predict pharmacotherapy resistance and guide the prescription of pharmacotherapy combined with psychotherapy could be a cost-effective strategy.},

Methods: We conducted a systematic review using multiple databases from inception to 2018. The titles and abstracts of cost-effectiveness studies on PGx-guided treatment in CVD care were screened, and full texts were extracted. Results: We screened 909 studies and included 46 to synthesize. Acute coronary syndrome and atrial fibrillation were the predominantly studied conditions (59%). Most studies (78%) examined warfarin–CYP2C9/VKORC1 or clopidogrel–CYP2C19. A payer’s perspective was commonly used (39%) for cost calculations, and most studies (46%) were US-based. The majority (67%) of the studies found PGx testing to be cost-effective in CVD care, but cost-effectiveness varied across drugs and conditions. Two studies examined PGx panel testing, of which one examined pre-emptive testing strategies. Conclusion: We found mixed evidence on the cost-effectiveness of PGx in CVD care. Supportive evidence exists for clopidogrel–CYP2C19 and warfarin–CYP2C9/VKORC1, but evidence is limited in other drug–gene combinations. Gaps persist, including unclear explanation of perspective and cost inputs, underreporting of study design elements critical to economic evaluations, and limited examination of PGx panel and pre-emptive testing for their cost-effectiveness. This review identifies the need for further research on economic evaluations of PGx implementation.},

More than ten antidepressants (including tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine) have already genetic biomarkers of response/side effects in clinical guidelines and drug labels. These are represented by functional genetic variants in genes coding for cytochrome enzymes (CYP2D6 and CYP2C19). Depending on the predicted metabolic activity, guidelines provide recommendations on drug choice and dosing. Despite not conclusive, the current evidence suggests that testing can be useful in patients who did not respond or tolerate at least one previous pharmacotherapy. However, the current recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic genes only (CYP450 enzymes), while pharmacodynamic genes (modulating antidepressant mechanisms of action in the brain) are still being studied because of their greater complexity. This may be captured by polygenic risk scores, which reflect the cumulative contribution of many genetic variants to a trait, and they may provide future clinical applications of pharmacogenetics. A more extensive use of genotyping in clinical practice may lead to improvement in treatment outcomes thanks to personalized treatments, but possible ethical issues and disparities should be taken into account and prevented.},

   abstract = {Background: Depressive disorders are associated with a high burden of disease. However, due to the burden posed by the disease on not only the sufferers, but also on their relatives, there is an ongoing debate about which costs to include and, hence, which perspective should be applied. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to examine whether the change between healthcare payer and societal perspective leads to different conclusions of cost-utility analyses in the case of depression. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify economic evaluations of interventions in depression, launched on Medline and the Cost-Effectiveness Registry of the Tufts University using a ten-year time horizon (2008-2018). In a two-stepped screening process, cost-utility studies were selected by means of specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, relevant findings was extracted and, if not fully stated, calculated by the authors of this work. Results: Overall, 53 articles with 92 complete economic evaluations, reporting costs from healthcare payer/provider and societal perspective, were identified. More precisely, 22 estimations (24%) changed their results regarding the cost-effectiveness quadrant when the societal perspective was included. Furthermore, 5% of the ICURs resulted in cost-effectiveness regarding the chosen threshold (2% of them became dominant) when societal costs were included. However, another four estimations (4%) showed the opposite result: these interventions were no longer cost-effective after the inclusion of societal costs. Conclusions: Summarising the disparities in results and applied methods, the results show that societal costs might alter the conclusions in cost-utility analyses. Hence, the relevance of the perspectives chosen should be taken into account when carrying out an economic evaluation. This systematic review demonstrates that the results of economic evaluations can be affected by different methods available for estimating non-healthcare costs.},

   abstract = {Most of our study of probability has dealt with independent trials processes. These processes are the basis of classical probability theory and much of statistics. We have discussed two of the principal theorems for these processes: the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. We have seen that when a sequence of chance experiments forms an independent trials process, the possible outcomes for each experiment are the same and occur with the same probability. Further, knowledge of the outcomes of the previous experiments does not influence our predictions for the outcomes of the next experiment. The distribution for the outcomes of a single experiment is sufficient to construct a tree and a tree measure for a sequence of n experiments, and we can answer any probability question about these experiments by using this tree measure. Modern probability theory studies chance processes for which the knowledge of previous outcomes influences predictions for future experiments. In principle, when we observe a sequence of chance experiments, all of the past outcomes could influence our predictions for the next experiment. For example, this should be the case in predicting a student's grades on a sequence of exams in a course. But to allow this much generality would make it very difficult to prove general results. In 1907, A. A. Markov began the study of an important new type of chance process. In this process, the outcome of a given experiment can affect the outcome of the next experiment. This type of process is called a Markov chain. We describe a Markov chain as follows: We have a set of states, S = \{s 1 , s 2 ,. .. , s r \}. The process starts in one of these states and moves successively from one state to another. Each move is called a step. If the chain is currently in state s i , then it moves to state s j at the next step with a probability denoted by p ij , and this probability does not depend upon which states the chain was in before the current 405},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials indicate that pharmacogenetic-guided treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) results in higher treatment response rates by genetically matching patients to medications and avoiding a trial-and-error process. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacogenetic test (IDGx) that has demonstrated effectiveness compared with standard of care (SOC) medication management among patients with varied MDD severity. METHODS: Data from a large prospective, randomized controlled trial of treatment-naive patients or patients with inadequately controlled MDD in general practice and psychiatric treatment settings were used to build a Markov state-transition probability model. Analyses were conducted from the societal perspective. Treatment response rates, mortality rates, direct and indirect medical costs, and utility inputs were derived from the reference study and published scientific literature. The cost of the pharmacogenetic test was $2,000. A 3% discount rate was used to discount costs and effects. Univariate one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of input parameters on net monetary benefit. RESULTS: For moderate to severe MDD, the model estimated a cumulative effect over 3 years of 2.07 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the pharmacogenetic- guided treatment group and 1.97 QALYs for the SOC group, including a lower probability of death from suicide (0.328% and 0.351%, respectively). Total costs over 3 years were $44,697 (IDGx) and $47,295 (SOC). This difference includes a savings of $2,918 in direct medical costs and $1,680 in indirect costs. Results were more pronounced when only severely depressed patients were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenetic testing among moderate to severe MDD patients improved QALYs and resulted in cost savings. Sensitivity analyses supported the robust nature of the current findings of the dominant IDGx test to guide treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term care (LTC) homes have been the epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Canada to date. Previous research shows that for-profit LTC homes deliver inferior care across a variety of outcome and process measures, raising the question of whether forprofit homes have had worse COVID-19 outcomes than nonprofit homes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 29 to May 20, 2020, using a COVID-19 outbreak database maintained by the Ontario Ministry of Long-Term Care. We used hierarchical logistic and count-based methods to model the associations between profit status of LTC homes (for-profit, nonprofit or municipal) and COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC homes, the extent of COVID-19 outbreaks (number of residents infected), and deaths of residents from COVID-19. RESULTS: The analysis included all 623 Ontario LTC homes, comprising 75 676 residents; 360 LTC homes (57.7%) were for profit, 162 (26.0%) were nonprofit, and 101 (16.2%) were municipal homes. There were 190 (30.5%) outbreaks of COVID-19 in LTC homes, involving 5218 residents and resulting in 1452 deaths, with an overall case fatality rate of 27.8%. The odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were associated with the incidence of COVID-19 in the public health unit region surrounding an LTC home (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-3.05), the number of residents (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.61), and older design standards of the home (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.38), but not profit status. For-profit status was associated with both the extent of an outbreak in an LTC home (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.96, 95% CI 1.26-3.05) and the number of resident deaths (adjusted RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.07), compared with nonprofit homes. These associations were mediated by a higher prevalence of older design standards in for-profit LTC homes and chain ownership. INTERPRETATION: For-profit status is associated with the extent of an outbreak of COVID-19 in LTC homes and the number of resident deaths, but not the likelihood of outbreaks. Differences between for-profit and nonprofit homes are largely explained by older design standards and chain ownership, which should be a focus of infection control efforts and future policy.},

   abstract = {Background: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are vulnerable to outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Timely epidemiological surveillance is essential for outbreak response, but is complicated by a high proportion of silent (non-symptomatic) infections and limited testing resources. Methods: We used a stochastic, individual-based model to simulate transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along detailed inter-individual contact networks describing patient-staff interactions in a real LTCF setting. We simulated distribution of nasopharyngeal swabs and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests using clinical and demographic indications and evaluated the efficacy and resource-efficiency of a range of surveillance strategies, including group testing (sample pooling) and testing cascades, which couple (i) testing for multiple indications (symptoms, admission) with (ii) random daily testing. Results: In the baseline scenario, randomly introducing a silent SARS-CoV-2 infection into a 170-bed LTCF led to large outbreaks, with a cumulative 86 (95% uncertainty interval 6-224) infections after 3 weeks of unmitigated transmission. Efficacy of symptom-based screening was limited by lags to symptom onset and silent asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. Across scenarios, testing upon admission detected just 34-66% of patients infected upon LTCF entry, and also missed potential introductions from staff. Random daily testing was more effective when targeting patients than staff, but was overall an inefficient use of limited resources. At high testing capacity (> 10 tests/100 beds/day), cascades were most effective, with a 19-36% probability of detecting outbreaks prior to any nosocomial transmission, and 26-46% prior to first onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Conversely, at low capacity (< 2 tests/100 beds/day), group testing strategies detected outbreaks earliest. Pooling randomly selected patients in a daily group test was most likely to detect outbreaks prior to first symptom onset (16-27%), while pooling patients and staff expressing any COVID-like symptoms was the most efficient means to improve surveillance given resource limitations, compared to the reference requiring only 6-9 additional tests and 11-28 additional swabs to detect outbreaks 1-6 days earlier, prior to an additional 11-22 infections.},

   abstract = {Background: The reproduction number (R0) is vital in epidemiology to estimate the number of infected people and trace close contacts. R0 values vary depending on social activity and type of gathering events that induce infection transmissibility and its pathophysiology dependence. Objectives: In this study, we estimated the probable outbreak size of COVID-19 clusters mathematically using a simple model that can predict the number of COVID-19 cases as a function of time. Methods: We proposed a mathematical model to estimate the R0 of COVID-19 in an outbreak occurring in both local and international clusters in light of published data. Different types of clusters (religious, wedding, and industrial activity) were selected based on reported events in different countries between February and April 2020. Results: The highest R0 values were found in wedding party events (5), followed by religious gathering events (2.5), while the lowest value was found in the industrial cluster (2). In return, this will enable us to assess the trend of coronavirus spread by comparing the model results and observed patterns. Conclusions: This study provides predictive COVID-19 transmission patterns in different cluster types based on different R0 values. This model offers a contact-tracing task with the predicted number of cases, to decision-makers; this would help them in epidemiological investigations by knowing when to stop.},

Machine learning models such as SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from the official portal of the Government of India in the time period of 30th January, 2020, to 10th May, 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R0, which is the spread of the disease, was calculated to be 2.84. Expected cases are predicted around 175K-200K in the three-week time period of test data, which is very close to the actual numbers. This study will help the government and doctors in preparing their plans for the future.},

A continued rise in the number of patients testing positive for COVID-19 has created a lot of stress on governing bodies across the globe and they are finding it difficult to tackle the situation. We have developed an outbreak prediction system for COVID-19 for the top 10 highly and densely populated countries. The proposed prediction models forecast the count of new cases likely to arise for successive 5 days using 9 different machine learning algorithms. A set of models for predicting the rise in new cases, having an average accuracy of 87.9% ± 3.9% was developed for 10 high population and high density countries. The highest accuracy of 99.93% was achieved for Ethiopia using Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) averaged over the next 5 days. The proposed prediction models used by us can help stakeholders to be prepared in advance for any sudden rise in outbreak to ensure optimal management of available resources.},

It is now superlative to use AI to detect and predict pandemics of a colossal nature. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in Wuhan China, has had disastrous effects on the global community and has overburdened advanced healthcare systems throughout the world. Globally; over 4,063,525 confirmed cases and 282,244 deaths have been recorded as of 11th May 2020, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control agency. However, the current rapid and exponential rise in the number of patients has necessitated efficient and quick prediction of the possible outcome of an infected patient for appropriate treatment using AI techniques. This paper proposes a fine-tuned Random Forest model boosted by the AdaBoost algorithm. The model uses the COVID-19 patient’s geographical, travel, health, and demographic data to predict the severity of the case and the possible outcome, recovery, or death. The model has an accuracy of 94% and a F1 Score of 0.86 on the dataset used. The data analysis reveals a positive correlation between patients’ gender and deaths, and also indicates that the majority of patients are aged between 20 and 70 years.},

   abstract = {Background: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. Methods: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. Findings: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0–13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. Interpretation: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

   abstract = {Much has been published in leading medical journals about the phenomenon of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The resulting condition, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a societal effect comparable only to the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. As the flow of clinical science has better informed the contemporary narratives, more is being learned about which individuals and groups experience the most dire complications. Researchers have emphasized older age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity , concomitant cardiovascular diseases (including coronary artery disease and heart failure), and myocardial injury as important risk factors associated with worse outcomes ; specifically, case-fatality rates vary over 100%. 1-3 These data sourced from China and Europe have not been replicated in the US, but the US experience may nevertheless represent similarly distressing outcomes in these highest-risk phenotypes. The concerns about these observations are appropriate and the published data are indeed actionable; those who fit the highest-risk phenotypes can be advised to assiduously adhere to safe practices including hand hygiene, use of masks in public spaces, and social distancing/physical isolation. 4 These measures not only are flattening the curve but are no doubt saving lives. However, a new concern has arisen: evidence of potentially egregious health care disparities is now apparent. Persons who are African American or black are contracting SARS-CoV-2 at higher rates and are more likely to die. 5 Why is this uniquely important to me? I am an academic cardiologist; I study health care disparities; and I am a black man. What is currently known about these differences in disease risk and fatality rates? In Chicago, more than 50% of COVID-19 cases and nearly 70% of COVID-19 deaths involve black individuals, although blacks make up only 30% of the population. Moreover, these deaths are concentrated mostly in just 5 neighborhoods on the city's South Side. 6 In Louisiana, 70.5% of deaths have occurred among black persons, who represent 32.2% of the state's population. 7 In Michigan, 33% of COVID-19 cases and 40% of deaths have occurred among black individuals, who represent 14% of the population. 5 If New York City has become the epicen-ter, this disproportionate burden is validated again in underrepresented minorities, especially blacks and now Hispanics, who have accounted for 28% and 34% of deaths, respectively (population representation: 22% and 29%, respectively). 8},

   abstract = {Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a recently discovered paramyxovirus, is thought to be primarily a winter-spring pathogen affecting young children with a clinical presentation similar to that of respiratory syncytial virus. In June-July 2006, a respiratory outbreak in a long-term-care facility was reported to the local health department and investigated. Surveillance identified 26 residents and 13 staff with acute respiratory illness; 8 residents (31%) developed radiograph-ically confirmed pneumonia, and 2 (5%) were hospitalized. Five of 14 respiratory specimens were positive by polymerase chain reaction assay for hMPV; sequencing identified genotype A. In institutionalized elderly persons, hMPV may be an important cause of respiratory outbreaks year-round. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently described virus in the Paramyxoviridae family [1]. Since its discovery in 2001, reports in the literature have suggested that hMPV can cause seasonal acute respiratory illnesses in individuals of all ages but predominantly in children [1, 2]. Similar to young children, frail elderly persons are often considered to be especially vulnerable to severe complications and increased morbidity and mortality from a variety of viral infections. To date, the epidemiology and clinical presentation of hMPV in elderly persons has not been well described. In the present report, we describe an outbreak of hMPV infection occurring in the summer months in a long-term-care facility (LTCF). Subjects, materials, and methods. In June 2006, a respiratory illness outbreak in a 171-bed LTCF was reported to the Sacramento County Department of Health and Human Services and the California Department of Health Services (CDHS). A subsequent outbreak investigation included the initiation of active surveillance for new cases of respiratory illnesses in residents and staff and collection of specimens from ill patients when feasible. Cases were defined by the presence of new respiratory symptoms, including cough, chest congestion, pu-rulent sputum, rhinitis, sore throat, shortness of breath, and/ or fever. Epidemiologic and clinical data from ill residents were obtained from a review of medical records and from staff by interview using a standardized questionnaire. Nasopharyngeal swabs were transported on ice to the Sacramento County Public Health Laboratory and the CDHS Viral and Rickettsial Laboratory. Informed consent and approval from an institutional review board were not obtained, because these data were collected as part of a public health investigation. The nasopharyngeal specimens were cultured for viruses by (1) the R-mix shell vial assay that uses a mixture of A549 and mink lung cells to detect influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus types 1-3, and ad-enovirus (Diagnostic Hybrids) and (2) conventional cultures with primary rhesus monkey kidney (RhMK) cells and human fetal diploid lung cells with gentamicin (10 mg/mL) and fun-gizone (1 mg/mL) in roller tubes (0.2 mL/tube, 2 tubes each) at 33C. Cultures were observed daily for 14 days. Hemad-sorption with guinea pig red blood cells on RhMK cells was performed at 7 and 14 days. Culture was also performed for Bordatella pertussis and B. parapertussis using Regan Lowe plates and chocolate agar. Total nucleic acid was extracted using the MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Technologies). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with primers for viruses (influenza A and B virus, RSV, ade-novirus, and hMPV) [3] and B. pertussis and B. parapertussis (Cepheid). Primers and probe for the hMPV fusion protein gene were obtained from a protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and posted on the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) Web site for use by public health laboratories [3]. At present, this hMPV assay is used for the purposes of epidemiologic surveillance and research only. Each specimen that was positive for hMPV by the APHL real-time PCR was also tested with conventional reverse},

   abstract = {Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been particularly severe among individuals residing in long-term care (LTC) facilities. As of April 10, 2020, half of Canada's COVID-19 deaths had occurred in LTC facilities. Objective: To better understand trends and risk factors associated with COVID-19 death in LTC facilities in Ontario, Canada. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of 627 LTC facilities included 269 total individuals who died of COVID-19 in Ontario to April 11, 2020, and 83 individuals who died of COVID-19 in Ontario LTC facilities to April 7, 2020. Because population denominators were not available for LTC residents, they were approximated as the total number of LTC facility beds in Ontario (79 498), assuming complete occupancy. Exposures: Confirmed or suspected COVID-19 outbreaks; confirmed COVID-19 infection among residents and staff, diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: COVID-19-specific mortality incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for LTC residents were calculated with community-living Ontarians older than 69 years as the comparator group. Count-based regression methods were used to model temporal trends and to identify associations of infection risk among staff and residents with subsequent LTC resident death. Model-derived IRRs for COVID-19-specific mortality were generated through bootstrap resampling (1000 replicates) to generate median and 95% credible intervals for IRR over time. Results: Of 627 LTC facilities, 272 (43.4%) reported COVID-19 infection in residents or staff. Of 1 731 315 total individuals older than 69 years living in Ontario during the study period, 229 (<0.1%) died; of 79 498 potential residents in LTC facilities, 83 (0.1%) died. The IRR for COVID-19-related death in LTC residents was 13.1 (95% CI, 9.9-17.3) compared with community-living adults older than 69 years. The IRR increased sharply over time and was 87.3 (95% credible interval, 6.4-769.8) by April 11, 2020. Infection among LTC staff was associated with death among residents with a 6-day lag (eg, adjusted IRR for death per infected staff member, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of COVID-19-related deaths during the pandemic in Ontario, Canada, mortality risk was concentrated in LTC residents and increased during a short period. Early identification of risk requires a focus on testing, providing personal protective equipment to staff, and restructuring the LTC workforce to prevent the movement of COVID-19 between facilities.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of national nursing home COVID-19 reports linked to other data. Multivariable two-part models modeled disparities in count of cases or deaths, and logistic regressions modeled disparities in self-reported shortages in staff and personal protective equipment (PPE), across nursing home groups with varying proportions of racial/ethnic minority residents, defined as low-, medium-, medium-high–, and high-proportion groups. SETTING: A total of 12,576 nursing homes nationally. PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of incident COVID-19 confirmed cases among residents and staff, and incident COVID-19 related deaths among residents (primary outcomes); and nursing home reported shortages in staff and PPE (secondary outcomes). All outcomes were reported for the week of May 25, 2020. RESULTS: The number of weekly new COVID-19 confirmed cases among residents ranged from an average of 0.4 cases per facility (standard deviation (SD) = 2.5) for the low-proportion group (93.0% had zero new cases) to 1.5 cases per facility (SD = 6.3) for the high-proportion group (78.9% had zero new cases). Multivariable regression estimated that compared with the low-proportion group, the likelihood of having at least one new resident case was 76% higher (odds ratio = 1.76; 95% confidence interval = 1.38–2.25; P =.000) for the high-proportion group. Similar across-facility disparities were found for the weekly count of new COVID-19 deaths among residents (ranging from 0.1 deaths per facility (SD = 1.1) for the low-proportion group to 0.4 deaths (SD = 2.0) for the high-proportion group) and in the weekly count of new COVID-19 confirmed cases among staff (ranging from 0.3 cases (SD = 1.4] to 1.3 cases (SD = 4.4) per facility). No substantial disparities in self-reported shortages of staff or PPE were found. CONCLUSION: Nursing homes caring for disproportionately more racial/ethnic minority residents reported more weekly new COVID-19 confirmed cases and/or deaths. Immediate actions are needed to address these system-level disparities.},

   abstract = {This research attempts to provide an innovative approach to measuring Catastrophic Health Expenditure (CHE) that captures the dynamics of household assets globally. CHE is a major cause that pushes households into poverty or forces households already in poverty into even deeper poverty. The study estimates how dynamically measured CHE affects a household's assets by exploiting a panel dataset with a plethora of household financial information. The innovative approach is then validated by comparing the accuracies of future CHE incidence prediction, using the CHE indicators in the current period along with other household characteristics, fitted into a machine-learning classification algorithm.},

   abstract = {What is already known about this topic? Once SARS-CoV-2 is introduced in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF), rapid transmission can occur. What is added by this report? Following identification of a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a health care worker, 76 of 82 residents of an SNF were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 23 (30.3%) had positive test results, approximately half of whom were asymptomatic or presymptomatic on the day of testing. What are the implications for public health practice? Symptom-based screening of SNF residents might fail to identify all SARS-CoV-2 infections. Asymptomatic and presymptomatic SNF residents might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Once a facility has confirmed a COVID-19 case, all residents should be cared for using CDC-recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), with considerations for extended use or reuse of PPE as needed.},

   abstract = {Objective: This study examined the association between BMI and clinical outcomes among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Methods: A total of 10,861 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the Northwell Health system hospitals between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020, were included in this study. BMI was classified as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity classes I, II, and III. Primary outcomes were invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. Results: A total of 243 (2.2%) patients were underweight, 2,507 (23.1%) were normal weight, 4,021 (37.0%) had overweight, 2,345 (21.6%) had obesity class I, 990 (9.1%) had obesity class II, and 755 (7.0%) had obesity class III. Patients who had overweight (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27 [95% CI: 1.11-1.46]), obesity class I (OR = 1.48 [95% CI: 1.27-1.72]), obesity class II (OR = 1.89 [95% CI: 1.56-2.28]), and obesity class III (OR = 2.31 [95% CI: 1.88-2.85]) had an increased risk of requiring IMV. Underweight and obesity classes II and III were statistically associated with death (OR = 1.44 [95% CI: 1.08-1.92]; OR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.03-1.52]; OR = 1.61 [95% CI: 1.30-2.00], respectively). Among patients who were on IMV, BMI was not associated with inpatient deaths. Conclusions: Patients who are underweight or who have obesity are at risk for mechanical ventilation and death, suggesting that pulmonary complications (indicated by IMV) are a significant contributor for poor outcomes in COVID-19 infection.},

   abstract = {Background: Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have occurred worldwide in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), but the reasons why some facilities are particularly vulnerable to infection are poorly understood. We aimed to identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks in LTCFs. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults >65 years in England with linkage to SARS-CoV-2 test results. Exposures included: LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, and use of disease control measures. Main outcomes included risk factors for infection and outbreaks, estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and survey and test-based weighted estimates of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Findings: 5126/9081 (56%) LTCFs participated in the survey, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff. The weighted period prevalence of infection in residents and staff respectively was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.9-11.1%) and 3.8% (95%: 3.4-4.2%) and 2724 LTCFs (53.1%) had ≥1 infection. Odds of infection and/or outbreaks were reduced in LTCFs that paid sickness pay, cohorted staff, did not employ agency staff and had higher staff to resident ratios. Higher odds of infection and outbreaks were identified in facilities with more admissions, lower cleaning frequency, poor compliance with isolation and “for profit” status. Interpretation: Half of LTCFs had no cases suggesting they remain vulnerable to outbreaks. Reducing transmission from staff requires adequate sick pay, minimal use of temporary staff, improved staffing ratios and staff cohorting. Transmission from residents is associated with the number of admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on nursing homes in the US, with upwards of a third of deaths occurring in nursing homes, and more in long-term care facilities. By combining data on facility-level COVID-19 deaths with facility-level data on the neighborhoods where nursing home staff reside for a sample of eighteen states, this paper finds that staff neighborhood characteristics are a large and significant predictor of COVID-19 outbreaks. One standard deviation increases in average staff tract population density, public transportation use, and non-white share were associated with 1.3 (SE .33), 1.4 (SE .35), and 0.9 (SE .24) additional deaths per 100 beds, respectively. These effects are larger than all facility management or quality variables, and larger than the effect of the nursing home's own neighborhood characteristics. These results suggest that staff communities are likely to be an important source of infection, and that disparities in nursing home outbreaks may be related to differences in the types of neighborhoods nursing home staff live in.},

However, the characteristics and risk factors associated with disease severity, unimprovement and mortality are unclear and our objective is to throw some light on these. Methods: All consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Results: A total of 663 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Among these, 247 (37.3%) had at least one kind of chronic disease; 0.5% of the patients (n = 3) were diagnosed with mild COVID-19, while 37.8% (251/663), 47.5% (315/663), and 14.2% (94/663) were in moderate, severe, and critical conditions, respectively. In our hospital, during follow-up 251 of 663 patients (37.9%) improved and 25 patients died, a mortality rate of 3.77%. Older patients (>60 years old) and those with chronic diseases were prone to have a severe to critical COVID-19 condition, to show unimprovement, and to die (p <0.001, <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified being male (OR = 0.486, 95%CI 0.311–0.758; p 0.001), having a severe COVID-19 condition (OR = 0.129, 95%CI 0.082–0.201; p <0.001), expectoration (OR = 1.796, 95%CI 1.062–3.036; p 0.029), muscle ache (OR = 0.309, 95%CI 0.153–0.626; p 0.001), and decreased albumin (OR = 1.929, 95%CI 1.199–3.104; p 0.007) as being associated with unimprovement in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Male sex, a severe COVID-19 condition, expectoration, muscle ache, and decreased albumin were independent risk factors which influence the improvement of COVID-19 patients.},

In this study, data on all recorded COVID-19 deaths in Sweden up to May 7, 2020 are linked to high-quality and accurate individual-level background data from administrative registers of the total population. By means of individual-level survival analysis we demonstrate that being male, having less individual income, lower education, not being married all independently predict a higher risk of death from COVID-19 and from all other causes of death. Being an immigrant from a low- or middle-income country predicts higher risk of death from COVID-19 but not for all other causes of death. The main message of this work is that the interaction of the virus causing COVID-19 and its social environment exerts an unequal burden on the most disadvantaged members of society.},

   abstract = {Description Remarks and examples References Also see Description Differential item functioning (DIF) occurs when items that are intended to measure a latent trait are unfair, favoring one group of individuals over another. This entry provides an overview of DIF. See the following manual entries for details about the individual DIF tests, including syntax and worked examples. diflogistic Logistic regression DIF test difmh Mantel-Haenszel DIF test Remarks and examples stata.com DIF is often investigated in conjunction with fitting item response theory (IRT) models. For an introduction to the IRT features in Stata, we encourage you to read [IRT] irt first. Investigating DIF involves evaluating whether a test item behaves differently across respondents with the same value of the latent trait. An item "functions differently" across individuals with the same latent trait level if these individuals have different probabilities of selecting a given response. A good overview of DIF procedures can be found in Penfield and Camilli (2007) and Osterlind and Everson (2009). Holland and Wainer (1993) provide a thorough treatment of statistical methodologies and practical issues surrounding DIF analysis. It is convenient to illustrate DIF using item characteristic curves even though many DIF diagnostics are not based on fitting an IRT model. These include the Mantel-Haenszel test available in difmh and the logistic regression test available in diflogistic. By convention, the hypothesized disadvantaged individuals are categorized as the focal group, and the advantaged ones are categorized as the reference group. The graph below shows an example of uniform DIF. The item favors the reference group over the entire range of the latent trait (ability). For example, given ability = 0, the probability of getting the item right is 0.73 for an individual from the reference group but only 0.50 for an individual from the focal group.},

IRT describes the relationship between a latent trait (e.g., the construct that the scale proposes to assess), the properties of the items in the scale, and respondents' answers to the individual items. This paper introduces the basic premise, assumptions, and methods of IRT. To help explain these concepts we generate a hypothetical scale using three items from a modified, binary (yes/no) response version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale that was administered to 19,399 respondents. We first conducted a factor analysis to confirm the unidimensionality of the three items and then proceeded with Mplus software to construct the 2-Parameter Logic (2-PL) IRT model of the data, a method which allows for estimates of both item discrimination and item difficulty. The utility of this information both for clinical purposes and for scale construction purposes is discussed.},

   abstract = {and clinical research centers. Participants: 191 experts in clinical and epidemiologic research (Internet survey, n147; expert interviews, n44). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Survey data were analyzed descriptively using t tests and 1-way analysis of variance to determine assessment priorities and core constructs. Descriptive analysis of expert interview rankings coupled with findings from the evidence-based literature reviews were used to identify appropriate outcomes measures. Results: The full Toolbox should: take less than 2 hours to administer; be precise and accurate across the range of normal function for people aged 3 to 85 years; be easy to administer, score, and interpret; and involve minimal cost. 54 construct areas and appropriate measures for each were identified across 4 core domains of motor function, cognition, sensation, and emotional health. Modifications to standard measures and development of new ones are recommended to meet the Toolbox's inclusion criteria. Implications for rehabilitation research are discussed using the motor and cognitive domains as exemplars. Conclusions: The NIH Toolbox will set the standard for measurement in NIH-funded research; will enable quick, precise measurement of key functional domains; and will facilitate cross-study comparisons. Disclosure: None declared. Objective: To evaluate the role of language barriers in using the English version of the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (E-SFMPQ). Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: University-based tertiary pain clinic. Participants: Chronic noncancer pain patients: 93 foreign-born speaking English as their second language and 233 Canadi-ans whose first language was English. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: E-SFMPQ scores including the number of sensory, affective, and total words used. Results: E-SFMPQ was completed in many instances by the foreign-born with the help of clinic staff or an English-speaking companion. The E-SFMPQ was completed by 98.3% of Canadian-born and 75% of foreign-born. The foreign-born group consisted of pain patients from 33 countries who reported 32 different languages as their primary language. Utilizing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th Edition pain disorder classification system, we observed no significant difference in the diagnostic categorization of patients based on contribution of physical (bio-medical) versus psychologic factors between the groups, while mean pain duration did not differ significantly (Canadian-born vs foreign-born, 72.6mo [range, 6-360mo] and 83.8mo [range, 6-600mo], respectively). The foreign-born proved to have very similar pain rating scores in the different dimensions of E-SFMPQ, with no statistically significant differences observed between the sensory and affective dimensions. Conclusions: Despite language difficulties, the E-SFMPQ is a valuable instrument for use with chronic pain patients. Translated versions may increase response rates between native and non-native English-speaking persons. Objective: To compare the measurement precision of static and dynamic instruments derived from the National Institutes of Health's Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Impact Bank to the precision of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) interference scale. Design: Items measuring pain impact were collected, tested, refined, and then submitted to large scale testing. Wave 1 testing included administration of full item banks and blocks of 7 items for each of 14 PROMIS domains. Responses of 15,833 people were used in a graded response model calibration of a 42-item bank of items measuring pain impact and the BPI. Short forms were derived from the item bank and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) were simulated. Setting: Clinics, online survey, and American Chronic Pain Association website. Participants: General and medical populations (N15,833). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: PROMIS Pain Impact Bank and BPI interference scale. Results: Two 6-item PROMIS short forms outperformed the 7-item BPI. One performed better for persons with lower levels of pain, the other for persons with higher levels of pain. CAT-administered pain impact items substantially improved precision of measurement with fewer items. A CAT with as few as 4 items outperformed all short forms and the BPI across the entire continuum of pain impact. Conclusions: The PROMIS Pain Impact Bank provides the mechanism for improved measurement of pain impact. CAT-based measurement of pain impacts results in good precision and reduced response burden. Disclosure: None declared. Objective: To explore the influence of physician outcome expectations on referral to physical therapy (PT) for patients with traumatic lower-extremity injury. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Clinical practice. Participants: 274 members of the Or-thopaedic Trauma Association. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Referral to PT based on 5 case vignettes. Results: Surgeons reported that 58% of their patients would have a positive outcome from PT and 24% a negative outcome. The highest PT expectations were for the appropriate use of assistive device(s) (81%) and improved range of motion and strength (76%). The lowest outcome expectations were for improvements in pain (36%), coping with the emotional aspects of disability (44%), and improvements in workplace limitations (51%). Physicians also reported that 27% of their patients referred to PT would have no improvement beyond what would naturally occur and 28% would receive inappropriate medical information. Multivariate analyses found positive physician outcome expectations to have the largest effect on referral to PT (odds ratio3.3, P.001). Conclusions: Results suggest that orthopedic trauma surgeons refer to PT based mostly on expectations for physical and motor outcomes, and that low referral rates may be attributed to a preference for surgeon-directed home-based rehabilitation. Future research should consider the effect of PT on various dimensions of pain and psychosocial aspects of recovery, and exploring the differences between supervised PT and physician-directed home exercise programs.},

   abstract = {Objectives. To examine the relationship between the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference (PI) and PROMIS Physical Function (PF) scales in patients with spinal pain at a university spine center. Design. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected patient-reported outcome data at a university spine clinic. Pearson correlation was done to examine the relationship of the PROMIS PF and PROMIS PI scores. Age, gender, and race were analyzed by subgroups on the PROMIS Physical Function and Pain Interference score. Linear regression analyzed predictive relationships. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Results. A total of 1,992 participants completed an assessment, with 1,923 completing the PF CAT and 1,927 the PI CAT. Participants' mean age was 52.8 years (range 5 18-94 years, SD 5 6.5 years). Correlation analysis of the PROMIS PF with the PROMIS PI showed a Pearson correlation value of-0.717 (P < 0.05). There was a strong linear relationship with a high negative correlation between PF CAT and PI CAT. The PI CAT predicted PF CAT scores (b 5-0.707, P < 0.001). Conclusions. For patients with pain from spinal origin , there is a strong negative correlation between self-reported physical function and pain interference related to physical, social, and mental health. The predictive relationship of function from pain scores supports the PROMIS PI being used as an important adjunct measure of physical function in patients with spinal pain.},

   abstract = {Background: To optimise measurement precision, relevance to patients and flexibility , patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) should ideally be adapted to the individual patient/study while retaining direct comparability of scores across patients/studies. This is achievable using item banks and computerised adaptive tests (CATs). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) is one of the most widely used PROMs in cancer research and clinical practice. Here we provide an overview of the research program to develop CAT versions of the QLQ-C30's 14 functional and symptom domains. Methods: The EORTC Quality of Life Group's strategy for developing CAT item banks consists of: literature search to identify potential candidate items; formulation of new items compatible with the QLQ-C30 item style; expert evaluations and patient interviews; field-testing and psychometric analyses, including factor analysis, item response theory calibration and simulation of measurement properties. In addition, software for setting up, running and scoring CAT has been developed. Results: Across eight rounds of data collections, 9782 patients were recruited from 12 countries for the field-testing. The four phases of development resulted in a total of 260 unique items across the 14 domains. Each item bank consists of 7e34 items. Psychometric evaluations indicated higher measurement precision and increased statistical power of the CAT measures compared to the QLQ-C30 scales. Using CAT, sample size requirements may be reduced by approximately 20e35% on average without loss of power. Conclusions: The EORTC CAT Core represents a more precise, powerful and flexible measurement system than the QLQ-C30. It is currently being validated in a large independent, international sample of cancer patients.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Deformable image registration (DIR) is often validated based on a distance-to-Agreement (DTA) criterion of automatically propagated anatomical landmarks that were manually identified. Due to human observer variability, however, the performance of the registration method is diluted. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an analysis of variance (ANOVA) based validation to account for such observer variation. Methods: Weekly cone beam CTs (CBCTs) of ten head and neck cancer patients undergoing five weeks of radiotherapy were used. An expert identified 23 anatomical features (landmarks) on the planning CT. The landmarks were automatically propagated to the CBCT using multiregion-of-interest (mROI) registration. Additionally, two human observers independently localized these landmarks on the CBCTs. Subsequently, ANOVA was used to compute the variance of each observer on the pairwise distance (PWD). Results: ANOVA based analysis demonstrated that a classical DTA approach underestimated the precision for the mROI due to human observer variation by about 25. The systematic error (accuracy) of mROI ranged from 0.13 to 0.17 mm; the variability (1 SD) (precision) ranged from 1.3 to 1.5 mm demonstrating that its performance is dominated by the precision. Conclusions: The PWD-ANOVA method accounts for human observer variation allowing a better estimation of the of DIR errors. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Background: Differential item functioning (DIF) methods can be used to determine whether different subgroups respond differently to particular items within a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) subscale, after allowing for overall subgroup differences in that scale. This article reviews issues that arise when testing for DIF in HRQoL instruments. We focus on logistic regression methods, which are often used because of their efficiency, simplicity and ease of application.Methods: A review of logistic regression DIF analyses in HRQoL was undertaken. Methodological articles from other fields and using other DIF methods were also included if considered relevant.Results: There are many competing approaches for the conduct of DIF analyses and many criteria for determining what constitutes significant DIF. DIF in short scales, as commonly found in HRQL instruments, may be more difficult to interpret. Qualitative methods may aid interpretation of such DIF analyses.Conclusions: A number of methodological choices must be made when applying logistic regression for DIF analyses, and many of these affect the results. We provide recommendations based on reviewing the current evidence. Although the focus is on logistic regression, many of our results should be applicable to DIF analyses in general. There is a need for more empirical and theoretical work in this area. © 2010 Scott et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Objective-Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are essential when evaluating many new treatments in health care, yet current measures have been limited by a lack of precision, standardization and comparability of scores across studies and diseases. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS ™) provides item banks that offer the potential for PRO measurement that is efficient (minimizes item number without compromising reliability) flexible (enables optional use of interchangeable items), and precise (has minimal error in estimate) measurement of commonly-studied PROs. We report results from the first large-scale testing of PROMIS items. Study Design and Setting-Fourteen item pools were tested in the U.S. general population and clinical groups using an online panel and clinic recruitment. A scale-setting sub-sample was created reflecting demographics proportional to the 2000 U.S. census. Results-Using item response theory (graded response model), 11 item banks were calibrated on a sample of 21,133, measuring components of self-reported physical, mental and social health, along with a 10-item global health scale. Short forms from each bank were developed and compared to the overall bank as well as with other well-validated and widely accepted ("legacy") measures. All item banks demonstrated good reliability across the majority of the score distributions. Construct validity was supported by moderate to strong correlations with legacy measures. Conclusion-PROMIS item banks and their short forms provide evidence they are reliable and precise measures of generic symptoms and functional reports comparable to legacy instruments. Further testing will continue to validate and test PROMIS items and banks in diverse clinical populations.},

   abstract = {The Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS ®), funded by the National Institutes of Health, aims to provide clinicians and researchers access to efficient, precise, valid, and responsive adult-and child-reported measures of health and well-being. PROMIS instruments are based on modern measurement theory and include the rigorous application of quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods approaches for instrument development. This document describes a set of standards that serve as the scientific foundation for the development and validation of PROMIS item banks and instruments. A general summary of instrument development and validation standards is followed by several appendices that outline specific components, followed by a final appendix that summarizes a maturity model for PROMIS item banks and instrument development and validation. The standards outlined in this document were based on the experience of PROMIS investigators, the published literature, and several existing sets of scientific methodology documents. These scientific standards are operationalized by a series of guidelines that provide detailed guidance for item bank development and validation, as well as summary of existing PROMIS practices. Reference citations are provided at the end of each individual guidance document. Similarly, the instrument maturity description document provides information concerning the readiness of measures derived from the PROMIS item banks for use in clinical research and practice. Instrument development and validation is a process of accumulating evidence and, therefore, some standards, such as those related to translation, validity, reliability, or interpretability, will pertain only to those item banks and instruments that have a relevant language translation or have achieved levels of validity, reliability, or responsiveness. Similarly, not every PROMIS product is a calibrated item bank, hence guideline regarding item banks and CAT instruments have limited applicability to these sets of items.},

We also report the use of the BPI-C in a three hospital study of cancer pain and its treatment. As with other language versions of the BPI, factor analysis of the BPI-C items results in a two factor solution that satisfies the criteria of reproducibility, interpretability and fit in a confirmatory setting. The first factor consists of the four pain severity scales, while the seven pain interference scales comprised the second factor. The BPI-C proved to be a reliable measure of both the severity and impact of pain in patients with cancer. Coefficient alphas for the pain severity and pain interference items were 0.894 and 0.915, respectively. The sample (N = 147) was gathered at three cancer treatment hospitals in Beijing. The patients from these hospitals reported higher levels of pain severity and pain interference compared with patients in similar studies done at the same time (1991-1992) in the United States and France. This was in keeping with the finding that a larger proportion (67%) of the cancer patients in these Beijing hospitals were judged to have inadequate analgesia as assessed by the Pain Management Index (PMI), an estimate of adherence to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for cancer pain management.},

The research objective was to develop a questionnaire module to be used, in addition to the European Organisation into Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, for measurement of quality of life (QL) among patients with uveal melanoma treated with methods such as transpupillary thermotherapy, plaque radiotherapy, proton beam radiotherapy, local resection, and enucleation. The present paper describes the development through Phases I-III. Methods. Relevant QL issues were generated from literature search and from interviews with ophthalmologists, nurses, and patients with uveal melanoma representing three major treatment options: enucleation, plaque brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy. Results. The provisional module was pretested in 61 patients from Finland, Sweden, and UK. The EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module consists of 26 items for all patients, and four additional items for patients receiving treatments other than enucleation. It measures ocular irritation, vision impairment, headache, worry about recurrent disease, problems with driving, problems with appearance functional problems due to vision impairment, and problems reading. Conclusions. Several treatment modalities are available for uveal melanoma. There is limited knowledge of the impact of these treatments on QL in the long and short term.

Each patient filled out the Polish version of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), the QLQ-OPT30 module and a personal questionnaire. Patients were divided into three groups according to treatment type, melanoma localisation and possible negative outcomes of the disease or treatment.

Treatment type and melanoma location did not influence the health-related quality of life. The QLQ-OPT30, apart from two scales, showed positive internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficients range: 0.70-0.88). We found the Polish version of the EORTC QLQ-OPT30 module a useful tool for measuring health-related quality of life in uveal melanoma patients.

   abstract = {Introduction: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 is a widely used health-related quality of life instrument. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether there are international differences in response to the questionnaire that can be explained by cultural factors. Methods: Analyses involved a database of 106 separate studies including data from over 28,000 respondents. Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses using logistic regression were conducted for each item of the EORTC QLQ-C30 with respect to cultural/geographic group. Results were qualitatively compared with previously reported DIF analyses by translation to explore whether the source of the DIF was more likely to be linguistic or cultural in nature. Results: Although most response patterns were similar, there were a number of international differences in how the questionnaire was answered. The largest variations were found in the results for Eastern Europe and East Asia. Results for the UK, the US and Australia tended to be similar. Many of the European results followed patterns that were more clearly explained when grouped by translation than when grouped by geographical region. Discussion: Our results suggest that, in general, the EORTC QLQ-C30 is suitable for use in a wide variety of countries and settings. Some response variations that have the potential to affect the results of international studies were identified, but it was not always clear whether the source of the variation was primarily linguistic or cultural.},

   abstract = {Forest ecosystems provide important ecological services and resources, from habitat for biodiversity to the production of environmentally friendly products, and play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Humanity is counting on forests to sequester and store a substantial portion of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide produced globally. However, the unprecedented rate of climate change, deforestation, and accidental importation of invasive insects and diseases are threatening the health and productivity of forests, and their capacity to provide these services. Knowledge of genetic diversity, local adaptation, and genetic control of key traits is required to predict the adaptive capacity of tree populations, inform forest management and conservation decisions, and improve breeding for productive trees that will withstand the challenges of the 21st century. Genomic approaches have well accelerated the generation of knowledge of the genetic and evolutionary underpinnings of nonmodel tree species, and advanced their applications to address these challenges. This special issue of Evolutionary Applications features 14 papers that demonstrate the value of a wide range of genomic approaches that can be used to better understand the biology of forest trees, including species that are widespread and managed for timber production, and others that are threatened or endangered, or serve important ecological roles. We highlight some of the major advances, ranging from understanding the evolution of genomes since the period when gymnosperms separated from angiosperms 300 million years ago to using genomic selection to accelerate breeding for tree health and productivity. We also discuss some of the challenges and future directions for applying genomic tools to address long-standing questions about forest trees.},

Methods: Standardized response means, standardized effect sizes, and receiver operating curve analyses were used to assess change between baseline and 3-month assessments in 250 participants who participated in a randomized clinical effectiveness trial of collab-orative telecare management for moderate to severe and persistent musculoskeletal pain. Results: The BPI, PEG, and SF-36 Bodily Pain measures were more sensitive to patient-reported global change than the PROMIS Pain Interference short forms, especially for the clinically improved group, for which the change detected by the PROMIS short forms was not statistically significant. The BPI was more responsive to the clinical intervention than the SF-36 Bodily Pain and PROMIS Pain Interference measures. Post hoc analyses exploring these findings did not suggest that differences in content or rating scale structure (number of response options or anchoring language) adequately explained the observed differences in the detection of change. Conclusions: In this clinical trial, the BPI and PEG measures were better able to detect change than the SF-36 Bodily Pain and PROMIS Pain Interference measures.},

This distress is not limited to the patient, as their partners also experience many psychological challenges. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programs have demonstrated clinical benefit for a variety of chronic illnesses, including cancer. This is the first study to report MBSR participation with partners of cancer patients. Methods: This study examined the impact of an 8-week MBSR program for 21 couples who attended the program together on outcomes of mood disturbance, symptoms of stress, and mindfulness. Results: Significant reductions for both patients and partners in mood disturbance (po0.05) and the Calgary Symptoms of Stress Inventory (C-SOSI) subscales of muscle tension (po0.01), neurological/GI (po0.05), and upper respiratory (po0.01) symptoms were observed after program participation. Significant increases in mindfulness (po0.05) were also reported in both groups. No significant correlations were observed between patient and partner scores on any measures at baseline or on change scores pre-to post-intervention; however, after MBSR participation couple's scores on the Profile of Mood States and C-SOSI were more highly correlated with one-another. Post-intervention, partners' mood disturbance scores were significantly positively correlated with patients' symptoms of stress and negatively correlated with patients' levels of mindfulness. Conclusions: Overall, the MBSR program was helpful for improving psychological functioning and mindfulness for both members of the couple. Several avenues of future research are suggested to further explore potential benefits of joint couple attendance in the MBSR program. A cancer diagnosis is highly distressing not only for the patient, but also for their partner, with high prevalence of emotional distress and psychiatric morbidity experienced by both [1]. Cancer patient and partner psychological experiences have a considerable impact on one another, such that when patients are distressed, partners tend to be as well [2-4]. These findings underscore the need for interventions targeted specifically at partners of cancer patients, as well as for the couple. The amount of research examining the benefits of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for cancer patients continues to grow. A recent meta-analysis obtained an effect size of 0.48 for mental health outcomes in cancer patients [5]. Documented benefits include improved stress, mood, anxiety , depressive symptoms, quality of life, and fear of recurrence after program participation [6-8]. Caregiver involvement in an MBSR program has been associated with decreases in symptoms of stress and mood disturbance for parents of children with chronic conditions [9]. MBSR programs for care-givers and staff working with Alzheimer patients have also been qualitatively explored with self-reported decreases in stress, anxiety and somatic complaints, increased satisfaction in the caregiver role, and improved ability to cope with stress [10]. No published studies report on the impact of MBSR participation for partners of cancer patients. The current study is a preliminary exploration of MBSR participation for couples affected by cancer. In particular, it examines the program's impact on symptoms of stress, mood disturbance, and mind-fulness for both cancer patients and their partners. It also begins to explore relationships between couples' outcomes.},

   abstract = {The field of health status and quality of life (QoL) measurement - as a formal discipline with a cohesive theoretical framework, accepted methods, and diverse applications - has been evolving for the better part of 30 years. To identify health status and QoL instruments and review them against rigorous criteria as a precursor to creating an instrument library for later dissemination, the Medical Outcomes Trust in 1994 created an independently functioning Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC). In the mid-1990s, the SAC defined a set of attributes and criteria to carry out instrument assessments; 5 years later, it updated and revised these materials to take account of the expanding theories and technologies upon which such instruments were being developed. This paper offers the SAC's current conceptualization of eight key attributes of health status and QoL instruments (i.e., conceptual and measurement model; reliability; validity; responsiveness; interpretability; respondent and administrative burden; alternate forms; and cultural and language adaptations) and the criteria by which instruments would be reviewed on each of those attributes. These are suggested guidelines for the field to consider and debate; as measurement techniques become both more familiar and more sophisticated, we expect that experts will wish to update and refine these criteria accordingly.},

Recent Findings A systematic review was conducted using four databases of articles published before January 1, 2020. Ten articles met the inclusion criteria (six randomized controlled trials, two single-arm studies, one non-randomized controlled trial, and one case series study). Studies were predominantly conducted with breast cancer patients using low-intensity hatha yoga programs. Of the 10 articles, five reported some positive effects on CACD, but significant biases were possible due to design shortcomings. Cohen's d effect sizes ranged from |0.03| to |0.74|. Summary The evidence to date is insufficient to suggest that yoga is beneficial for attenuating CACD. More rigorous trials controlling for non-specific factors are warranted. The field would also benefit from examining self-delivered modes of yoga for treating CACD in various cancer populations to enhance practice sustainability and generalizability.},

   abstract = {Measles, a vaccine-preventable illness, is one of the most infectious diseases known to man. In 2015, an estimated 134,200 measles deaths occurred globally. Rubella, also vaccine-preventable, is a concern because infection during pregnancy can result in congenital defects in the baby. More than 100,000 babies with congenital rubella syndrome were estimated to have been born globally in 2010. Eradication of both measles and rubella is considered to be feasible, beneficial, and more cost-effective than high-level control. All six World Health Organization (WHO) regions have measles elimination goals by 2020 and two have rubella elimination goals by that year. However, the World Health Assembly has not endorsed a global eradication goal for either disease. In 2012, the Measles and Rubella Initiative published a Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan, 2012-2020, referred to hereafter as the Plan, which aimed to achieve measles and rubella elimination in at least five WHO regions by end-2020 through the implementation of five core strategies, with progress evaluated against 2015 milestones. When, by end-2015, none of these milestones had been met, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended a mid-term review of the Plan to evaluate progress toward goals, assess the quality of strategy implementation, and formulate lessons learned. A five-member team reviewed documents and conducted interviews with stakeholders as the basis for the review's conclusions and recommendations. This team concluded that, although significant progress in measles elimination had been made, progress had slowed. It recommended that countries continue to work toward elimination goals with a focus on strengthening ongoing immunization systems. In addition, it concluded that the strategies articulated in the Plan were sound, however full implementation had been impeded by inadequate country ownership and global political will, reflected in inadequate resources. Detailed recommendations for each of the Plan's five strategies as well as the areas of polio transition, governance and resource mobilization are outlined.},

   abstract = {Background. A service delivery model using group acupuncture (AP) may be more cost-effective than individual AP in general, but there is little evidence to assess whether group AP is a comparable treatment in terms of efficacy to standard individual AP. .e study aimed to compare the group to individual delivery of 6-week AP among cancer patients with pain. Methods. .e study design was a randomized noninferiority trial of the individual (gold standard treatment) vs. group AP for cancer pain. .e primary outcome was pain interference and severity, measured through the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Secondary outcomes included measures of mood, sleep, fatigue, and social support.

Mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) is an evidence-based intervention for treating such symptoms, but has not been investigated as an adjunctive treatment during CT. This study aims to determine the efficacy of an online group MBCR programme delivered during CT in 12 real-time interactive weekly sessions for managing fatigue (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes include sleep disturbance, pain, nausea/vomiting, mood, stress and QoL. Exploratory outcomes include cognitive function, white blood cell counts and return to work. The study is a two-armed randomised controlled waitlist trial with 2:1 allocation to treatment (online group MBCR during CT) or control (waitlist usual care; online MBCR following CT completion) with a target sample size of N = 178. Participants are breast or colorectal cancer patients undergoing common CT regimens in Calgary, Canada. Online assessments using validated self-reported instruments will take place at baseline, post-MBCR, post-CT and 12 months’ post-baseline. If online MBCR delivered during CT significantly reduces fatigue in cancer patients’ post-CT and also impacts secondary symptoms, this would provide evidence for including mindfulness training as an adjunctive symptom management therapy during CT.},

This study is officially advocated and reported by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. By publishing our midterm data, we intend to disseminate the benefits of LBEC system, using the descriptive reporting format and algorithmic interpretational approach. Methods: From April 2014 to December 2015, we consecutively assessed 1116 LBEC specimens and 1044 SETB specimens in our five outpatient clinics. Results: The sensitivity of suction tissue biopsies was 85.2%, whereas the sensitivity of LBEC was 92.2%. The specificity of suction tissue biopsies was 98.9% and that of LBEC was 98.5%. The negative predictive value of LBEC (99.1%) was higher than that of SETB (98.1%), although the difference between these values was not significant. Conclusions: The clinical performance of LBEC for detecting endometrial malignancies was almost identical to the performance of SETB. This indicates that LBEC was not inferior to SETB for the detection of endometrial cancer. The LBEC is appropriate for various clinical situations as the first-step detecting tool. In addition, it could be used for cancer surveillance for women with signs highly suggestive of endometrial malignancies and in Lynch syndrome patients, on a larger scale.},

Here we show, using a prospective ('pre'-'post' pregnancy) study involving first-time mothers and fathers and nulliparous control groups, that pregnancy renders substantial changes in brain structure, primarily reductions in gray matter (GM) volume in regions subserving social cognition. The changes were selective for the mothers and highly consistent, correctly classifying all women as having undergone pregnancy or not in-between sessions. Interestingly, the volume reductions showed a substantial overlap with brain regions responding to the women's babies postpartum. Furthermore, the GM volume changes of pregnancy predicted measures of postpartum maternal attachment, suggestive of an adaptive process serving the transition into motherhood. Another follow-up session showed that the GM reductions endured for at least 2 years post-pregnancy. Our data provide the first evidence that pregnancy confers long-lasting changes in a woman's brain.},

   abstract = {Background. Surname lists are useful for identifying cohorts of ethnic minority patients from secondary data sources. This study sought to develop and validate lists to identify people of South Asian and Chinese origin. Methods. Comprehensive lists of South Asian and Chinese surnames were reviewed to identify those that uniquely belonged to the ethnic minority group. Surnames that were common in other populations, communities or ethnic groups were specifically excluded. These surname lists were applied to the Registered Persons Database, a registry of the health card numbers assigned to all residents of the Canadian province of Ontario, so that all residents were assigned to South Asian ethnicity, Chinese ethnicity or the General Population. Ethnic assignment was validated against self-identified ethnicity through linkage with responses to the Canadian Community Health Survey. Results. The final surname lists included 9,950 South Asian surnames and 1,133 Chinese surnames. All 16,688,384 current and former residents of Ontario were assigned to South Asian ethnicity, Chinese ethnicity or the General Population based on their surnames. Among 69,859 respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey, both lists performed extremely well when compared against self-identified ethnicity: positive predictive value was 89.3% for the South Asian list, and 91.9% for the Chinese list. Because surnames shared with other ethnic groups were deliberately excluded from the lists, sensitivity was lower (50.4% and 80.2%, respectively). Conclusions. These surname lists can be used to identify cohorts of people with South Asian and Chinese origins from secondary data sources with a high degree of accuracy. These cohorts could then be used in epidemiologic and health service research studies of populations with South Asian and Chinese origins. © 2010 Shah et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a common method used to describe and quantitatively assess preferences in health applications. Increasingly, DCEs have been used to elicit preferences from children and adolescents and generate evidence to inform policies affecting this population. Objectives The aim of this review was to summarize and describe the application of DCEs conducted with children and adolescents and describe author-reported age-specific considerations in design, implementation, and analysis. Methods A scoping review was conducted using a 'pearl-growing' technique whereby the reference lists of existing systematic reviews of DCEs were used to identify potential studies conducted with children or adolescents as respondents published between 1990 and 2017. This list was supplemented with an updated electronic search using the same strategy as the initial reviews to identify studies from 2017 to 2020. Results Of 480 studies identified, 19 were included; topics included vaccines (32%), drugs/medical devices (26%), treatment or health promotion interventions/programs (21%), warning labels on cigarettes/nicotine products (10%), and preferences for physical activity and healthy food choices (10%). The youngest reported age for independent DCE completion was 8 years. Approaches to assessing validity and reliability of choices were consistent with best practices for the conduct of DCEs. Reported age-specific considerations included use of visual aids, age-appropriate language, reducing task complexity and cognitive burden, and exploration of interpretation of willingness-to-pay. Conclusion The number of DCEs conducted with children and adolescents has increased in recent years. Detailed explanation of why reported age-specific considerations were necessary, how they could be used to interpret results, or to understand the appropriateness of this methodology for different age groups was limited. Despite a recognition of the need for special consideration when conducting DCEs in this population, the unique issues in the context of age-specific considerations are largely unexplored, and further research is required. Moving forward, stated preference research conducted with children and adolescents should report in more detail methods of recruitment, results of validity assessments, and provide specific reflection on the extent to which modeled results are consistent with expectations and underlying theory.},

   abstract = {Patient preference information (PPI) is a topic of interest to regulators and industry. One of many known methods for eliciting PPI is the threshold technique (TT). However, empirical studies of the TT differ from each other in many ways and no effort to date has been made to summarize them or the evidence regarding the performance of the method. We sought to describe the TT and summarize the empirical applications of the method. Forty-three studies were reviewed. Most studies estimated the minimum level of benefit required to make a treatment worthwhile, and over half estimated the maximum level of risk patients would accept to achieve a treatment benefit. The evidence demonstrates that the TT can be used to elicit multiple types of thresholds and can be used to explore preference heterogeneity and preference non-linearity. Some evidence suggests that the method may be sensitive to anchoring and shift-framing effects; however, no evidence suggests that the method is more or less sensitive to these potential biases than other stated-preference methods. The TT may be a viable method for eliciting PPI to support regulatory decision-making; however, additional understanding of the performance of this method may be needed. Future research should focus on TT performance compared with other stated-preference methods, the extent to which results predict patient choice, and the ability of the TT to inform individual treatment decisions at the point of healthcare delivery.},

   abstract = {Background. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is neurodegenerative, causing motor, cognitive, psychological, somatic, and autonomic symptoms. Understanding PD patients’ preferences for novel neurostimulation devices may help ensure that devices are delivered in a timely manner with the appropriate level of evidence. Our objective was to elicit preferences and willingness-to-wait for novel neurostimulation devices among PD patients to inform a model of optimal trial design. Methods. We developed and administered a survey to PD patients to quantify the maximum levels of risks that patients would accept to achieve potential benefits of a neurostimulation device. Threshold technique was used to quantify patients’ risk thresholds for new or worsening depression or anxiety, brain bleed, or death in exchange for improvements in “on-time,” motor symptoms, pain, cognition, and pill burden. The survey elicited patients’ willingness to wait to receive treatment benefit. Patients were recruited through Fox Insight, an online PD observational study. Results. A total of 2740 patients were included and a majority were White (94.6%) and had a 4-year college degree (69.8%). Risk thresholds increased as benefits increased. Threshold for depression or anxiety was substantially higher than threshold for brain bleed or death. Patient age, ambulation, and prior neurostimulation experience influenced risk tolerance. Patients were willing to wait an average of 4 to 13 years for devices that provide different levels of benefit. Conclusions. PD patients are willing to accept substantial risks to improve symptoms. Preferences are heterogeneous and depend on treatment benefit and patient characteristics. The results of this study may be useful in informing review of device applications and other regulatory decisions and will be input into a model of optimal trial design for neurostimulation devices.},

   abstract = {Objectives Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are routinely used to elicit patient preferences to improve health outcomes and healthcare services. While many fractional factorial designs can be created, some are more statistically optimal than others. The objective of this simulation study was to investigate how varying the number of (1) attributes, (2) levels within attributes, (3) alternatives and (4) choice tasks per survey will improve or compromise the statistical efficiency of an experimental design.

Design and methods A total of 3204 DCE designs were created to assess how relative design efficiency (d-efficiency) is influenced by varying the number of choice tasks (2–20), alternatives (2–5), attributes (2–20) and attribute levels (2–5) of a design. Choice tasks were created by randomly allocating attribute and attribute level combinations into alternatives.

Outcome Relative d-efficiency was used to measure the optimality of each DCE design.

Results DCE design complexity influenced statistical efficiency. Across all designs, relative d-efficiency decreased as the number of attributes and attribute levels increased. It increased for designs with more alternatives. Lastly, relative d-efficiency converges as the number of choice tasks increases, where convergence may not be at 100% statistical optimality.

Conclusions Achieving 100% d-efficiency is heavily dependent on the number of attributes, attribute levels, choice tasks and alternatives. Further exploration of overlaps and block sizes are needed. This study's results are widely applicable for researchers interested in creating optimal DCE designs to elicit individual preferences on health services, programmes, policies and products.},

Comparisons of and contrasts between these two types of programs are discussed and punctuated by the reasons for successes and failures. Today, southern pine tree improvement programs are on the cutting edge of genetic technology, moving from open-pollinated seed to clonal programs encompassing molecular genetic features.

The command calculates index values using value sets from eight countries: the United Kingdom, 1 Description The eq5d command computes an index value from individual responses to the EQ-5D quality-of-life instrument. The EQ-5D is a generic quality-of-life survey developed by the EuroQol Group and used widely by health economists and epidemiologists conducting applied work (EuroQol Group 1990). The EQ-5D survey includes five questions or domains covering mobility, self care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each domain contains three possible responses indicating "no problem", "some problems", or "extreme problems". Therefore, the EQ-5D yields 243 (or 3 5) possible health states that can be converted into an index value or a health-related quality-of-life score using a validated value set normally estimated using time trade-off methods and regression analysis. Initially only available in the United Kingdom, over the last decade, several country-specific value sets have been estimated and compiled by the EuroQol Group in Szende, Oppe, and Devlin (2007). The EQ-5D index has an upper bound equal to 1 that indicates full health (indicated by "no problem" in all domains), whereas 0 represents death. Negative values are allowed, and the lower bound varies depending on the country-specific value set used. eq5d provides users and programmers working with EQ-5D data in Stata with an easy implementation of the published country-specific value sets.},

   abstract = {Background: The 5-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) was recently developed. A number of preference-based scoring systems are being developed for several countries around the world. Objective: To develop a value set for the EQ-5D-5L based on societal preferences in Canada. Methods: We used age, sex, and education quota sampling from the general population from 4 cities across Canada. Composite time trade-off (cTTO) and traditional time trade-off (tTTO) were used as the main elicitation technique. A total of 86 EQ-5D-5L health states grouped into 10 blocks were valued using cTTO, whereas a subset of 18 severe states was also valued using tTTO. Participants meeting predefined inconsistency criteria were excluded from the analyses. For the value set development, we used tTTO and positive cTTO values, while censoring negative and zero cTTO values at zero. Models with the main effects presented using linear terms combined with various additional terms were estimated. The preferred model was selected based primarily on logically ordered coefficients, and secondly model fit. Results: Of the 1209 participants who completed the interview, 136 met criteria that excluded them from the primary analyses. The demographics and socioeconomic status of the remaining 1073 participants were similar to the Canadian general population. The preferred model has 5 linear terms for the main effects, a term for level 4 or 5 for each dimension, and a term for the squared total number of level 4 or 5 beyond the first. For this preferred model, the health utilities ranged from 0.148 for the worst (55555) to 0.949 for the best (11111) EQ-5D-5L states. Conclusions: This is the first TTO-based value set of the EQ-5D-5L for Canada. It can be used to support the health utility estimation in economic evaluations for reimbursement decision making in Canada.},

Thus, we need to pay more attention to the Carpinus plants that are not yet extinct but are endangered. Here, we employed the species distribution model (SDM) considering different climate change scenarios and human footprint to test the potential habitat changes of three Carpinus species (C. oblongifolia, C. tientaiensis, and C. purpurinervis) in the future. Our results showed that the mean diurnal range of temperature (MDRT), isothermality, mean temperature of wettest quarter, and human footprint were the most influential factors determining the distribution of C. oblongifolia. Precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation), MDRT, and precipitation of driest quarter were the most important climatic factors affecting C. tientaiensis. The minimum temperature of the coldest month was the most important factor in the distribution of C. purpurinervis. Our results also showed that the three species had different adaptability and habitat change trends under the future climate change scenarios, although they belong to the same genus. The potential habitats of C. oblongifolia would expand in the future, while the potential habitats of C. tientaiensis and C. purpurinervis would decrease for the same period. The predicted changes of these three endangered species on temporal and spatial patterns could provide a theoretical basis for their conservation strategies.},

Herein, we summarize a project characterizing the change history of Canada’s forested ecosystems with a time series of data representing 1984–2012. Using the Composite2Change approach, we applied spectral trend analysis to annual best-available-pixel (BAP) surface reflectance image composites produced from Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery. A total of 73,544 images were used to produce 29 annual image composites, generating ∼400 TB of interim data products and resulting in ∼25 TB of annual gap-free reflectance composites and change products. On average, 10% of pixels in the annual BAP composites were missing data, with 86% of pixels having data gaps in two consecutive years or fewer. Change detection overall accuracy was 89%. Change attribution overall accuracy was 92%, with higher accuracy for stand-replacing wildfire and harvest. Changes were assigned to the correct year with an accuracy of 89%. Outcomes of this project provide baseline information and nationally consistent data source to quantify and characterize changes in forested ecosystems. The methods applied and lessons learned build confidence in the products generated and empower others to develop or refine similar satellite-based monitoring projects.},

   abstract = {The quality of allochthonous organic matter influences the transfer of energy and nutrients through recipient food webs. We investigated the effects of variation in the composition of riparian forests (deciduous, mixed, coniferous) on the elemental imbalance between basal resources and consumers in streams, on consumer feeding and on potential feedbacks to riparian systems via emergent aquatic insects. We tested for differences in elemental stoichiometry (carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus; C/N/P) and stable isotopes (∂13C and ∂15N) between deciduous (red alder, Alnus rubra) and coniferous litter (western hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla) and among abundant stream invertebrates from streams draining different riparian forests (deciduous, mixed, coniferous). We then assessed shredder feeding preferences (of the trichopteran, Lepidostoma unicolor) for litter incubated in streams with these different forest types and quantified differences in emergence of aquatic and semiaquatic insects among streams. Both initial (non-incubated) and stream-incubated A. rubra litter had lower C/N and C/P and were more depleted in ∂13C and more enriched in ∂15N, than T. heterophylla litter. The stoichiometry of invertebrate tissue did not vary significantly among taxa or with riparian forest composition. A predator (the plecopteran Chloroperlidae) and a collector-gatherer (the ephemeropteran Paraleptophlebia gregalis) from mixed and coniferous forest streams were more enriched in ∂13C and ∂15N isotopes than those from deciduous streams, suggesting that low availability of palatable, N-rich A. rubra litter may constrain energy flow and nutrient fluxes up through the food web in systems with little or no A. rubra. Consumption of A. rubra litter by L. unicolor was most rapid when the litter had been incubated in streams draining deciduous forests, whereas consumption of T. heterophylla litter was not influenced by the composition of the riparian forest. 5. Peak insect emergence from coniferous forest streams occurred 1month earlier and at 2-3× higher density than from mixed and deciduous-forest streams, but total biomass of emerging insects throughout the study period was not different between forest types. Assemblages of emerging insects were different between deciduous and coniferous forest streams, and taxon richness and diversity were nearly 2× greater from deciduous than from coniferous forest streams. 6.Forest composition influences stream invertebrate feeding and could have reciprocal feedbacks onto riparian systems via altered insect emergence. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Developing spatially explicit conservation strategies for stream fishes requires an understanding of the spatial structure of dispersal within stream networks. We explored spatial patterns of stream fish dispersal by evaluating how the size and proximity of connected streams (i.e., stream network topology) explained variation in fish assemblage structure and how this relationship varied with local stream size. We used data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in wadeable streams of the Mid-Atlantic Highlands region (n = 308 sites). We quantified stream network topology with a continuous analysis based on the rate of downstream flow accumulation from sites and with a discrete analysis based on the presence of mainstem river confluences (i.e., basin area >250 km2) within 20 fluvial km (fkm) from sites. Continuous variation in stream network topology was related to local species richness within a distance of ∼10 fkm, suggesting an influence of fish dispersal within this spatial grain. This effect was explained largely by catostomid species, cyprinid species, and riverine species, but was not explained by zoogeographic regions, ecoregions, sampling period, or spatial autocorrelation. Sites near mainstem river confluences supported greater species richness and abundance of catostomid, cyprinid, and ictalurid fishes than did sites >20 fkm from such confluences. Assemblages at sites on the smallest streams were not related to stream network topology, consistent with the hypothesis that local stream size regulates the influence of regional dispersal. These results demonstrate that the size and proximity of connected streams influence the spatial distribution of fish and suggest that these influences can be incorporated into the designs of stream bioassessments and reserves to enhance management efficacy. © 2008 by The North American Benthological Society.},

   abstract = {Sinks can be located using the Sink tool. This tool requires a direction raster that is created by the Flow Direction tool. The result is a raster that identifies any existing sinks in the data. Depending on the results, you can fill the sinks, or you can use the output to help determine the fill limit. Sinks can be filled using the Fill tool. To use the output from Sink to determine the fill limit, refer to "Finding sink depth" in this topic (below). Filling sinks The Fill tool uses a variety of ArcGIS Spatial Analyst tools, including several of the hydrologic analysis tools discussed earlier, to create a depressionless DEM. This tool requires an input surface, a fill limit, and an output raster. When a sink is filled, it is filled to its pour point, the minimum elevation along its watershed boundary. The identification and removal of sinks when creating a depressionless DEM is an iterative process. When a sink is filled, the boundaries of the filled area may create new sinks, which then need to be filled. For a large DEM or one with many sinks, this can take minutes to hours. Finding sink depth It is useful to know the depth of a sink or group of sinks. This information can be used to determine an appropriate z limit for the Fill tool, to understand the type of errors present in the data, and to determine if the sinks are legitimate morphological features. The following steps outline the general process to find sink depth: 1. Create a raster of sinks with values that identify their depth by running the Sink tool to locate sinks in the raster. 2. Use the Watershed tool to create a raster of the contributing area for each sink using the flow direction from the elevation raster and the output from the Sink tool as input for pour points. 3. With Map Algebra in Python, use the Zonal Statistics tool with the Minimum option to create a raster of the minimum elevation in the watershed of each sink: Profile view of a sink ArcGIS 10},

   abstract = {Throughout the world, efforts are under way to restore watersheds, but restoration planning rarely accounts for future climate change. Using a series of linked models of climate, land cover, hydrology, and salmon population dynamics, we investigated the impacts of climate change on the effectiveness of proposed habitat restoration efforts designed to recover depleted Chinook salmon populations in a Pacific Northwest river basin. Model results indicate a large negative impact of climate change on freshwater salmon habitat. Habitat restoration and protection can help to mitigate these effects and may allow populations to increase in the face of climate change. The habitat deterioration associated with climate change will, however, make salmon recovery targets much more difficult to attain. Because the negative impacts of climate change in this basin are projected to be most pronounced in relatively pristine, high-elevation streams where little restoration is possible, climate change and habitat restoration together are likely to cause a spatial shift in salmon abundance. River basins that span the current snow line appear especially vulnerable to climate change, and salmon recovery plans that enhance lower-elevation habitats are likely to be more successful over the next 50 years than those that target the higher-elevation basins likely to experience the greatest snow-rain transition. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

At the individual-fish level, parr use of moderately vegetated areas was significantly higher than expected based on availability of such habitats, and use of heavily veg- etated areas was lower than expected. The use of vegetated areas was not independent of dominant substrate type. Use of moderately vegetated habitats exceeded expectations for gravel- and sand- dominated areas; for cobble-dominated areas, use of sites with little or no vegetation exceeded expectations. Approximately 95% of the observed parr were found in the vicinity of a discrete cover item (i.e., cobble, vegetation, or other). Parr typically held position in the immediate vicinity of a cobble particle or other large stone when such cover items were available. In areas with limited cobble cover, parr often held position in the vicinity of rooted aquatic macrophytes. In the absence of cobble cover, areas with moderate levels of aquatic vegetation provide a cover com- ponent to juvenile Atlantic salmon and are used to a greater extent than similar areas lacking such cover},

   abstract = {While many recovery programs for threatened species focus on acute sources of mortality, understanding some of the evolutionary processes of these species may lead to more effective recovery efforts, especially in cases where human-induced disturbances have resulted in artificial selection pressures. We developed a Monte Carlo test to determine whether Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) experienced selective mortality as a function of their juvenile length and timing of downstream migration. Actively migrating juvenile fish (smolts) were captured, tagged, and released in 1995 and 1996 approximately 700 km upstream from the Pacific Ocean, and returning adults were detected at the same location. We analyzed data from two groups of fish: Those that migrated downstream in-river and those that were barged downstream as part of the juvenile-salmon transportation program. These groups were further separated into wild and hatchery fish. Length at release was significantly greater in returning adults than in the general population for fish that migrated downstream in-river (both wild and hatchery) or were transported (hatchery only). From the 1995 seaward migration, adult returns of both wild and hatchery fish that migrated in-river were composed of fish released significantly earlier than the general population. In contrast, the opposite trend existed for wild and hatchery transported fish. From the 1996 seaward migration, no significant difference in release date was found between returning adults and the original population for any of the groups analyzed. Fish length at migration is a result of factors encountered in early life stages but selectively determines mortality in the smolt-to-adult stage. Thus freshwater habitat improvements, such as salmon carcass supplementation, directed at increasing nutrient levels and thus fish length may result in an increase in overall survival. The development of hydroelectric dams in the migratory corridors of these fish has disrupted their arrival timing to the estuary. Mitigation efforts designed to shift arrival timing toward that experienced prior to impoundment may confer considerable survival benefits.},

   abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) technology is capable of precisely measuring a variety of vegetation metrics, the estimates of which are usually based on relative heights above a digital elevation model (DEM). As a result, the development of these elevation models is a critical step when processing lidar observations. A number of different algorithms exist to interpolate lidar ground hits into a terrain surface. We tested seven interpolation routines, using small footprint lidar data, collected over a range of vegetation classes on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The lidar data were randomly subsetted into a prediction dataset and a validation dataset. A suite of DEMs were then generated using linear, quintic, natural neighbour, regularized spline, spline with tension, a finite difference approach (ANUDEM), and inverse distance weighted interpolation routines, at spatial resolutions of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m. In order to examine the effects of terrain and ground cover on interpolation accuracies, the study area was stratified by terrain slope, vegetation structural class, lidar ground return density, and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) derived from Quickbird and Landsat7 ETM+ imagery. The root mean square (RMS) and mean absolute errors of the residuals between the surfaces and the validation points indicated that the 0.5 m DEMs were the most accurate. Of the tested approaches, the regularized spline and IDW algorithms produced the most extreme outliers, sometimes in excess of ±6 m in sloping terrain. Overall, the natural neighbour algorithm provided the best results with a minimum of effort. Finally, a method to create prediction uncertainty maps using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis is proposed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Stream temperature controls a number of biological, chemical, and physical processes occurring in aquatic environments. Transient snow cover and advection associated with lateral throughflow inputs can have a dominant influence on stream thermal regimes for headwater catchments in the rain-on-snow zone. Most existing stream temperature models lack the ability to properly simulate these processes. We developed and evaluated a conceptual-parametric catchment-scale stream temperature model that includes the role of transient snow cover and lateral advection associated with throughflow. The model consists of routines for simulating canopy interception, snow accumulation and melt, hillslope throughflow runoff and temperature, and stream channel energy exchange processes. The model was used to predict discharge and stream temperature for a small forested headwater catchment near Vancouver, Canada, using long-term (1963–2013) weather data to compute model forcing variables. The model was evaluated against 4 years of observed stream temperature. The model generally predicted daily mean stream temperature accurately (annual RMSE between 0.57 and 1.24 °C) although it overpredicted daily summer stream temperatures by up to 3 °C during extended low streamflow conditions. Model development and testing provided insights on the roles of advection associated with lateral throughflow, channel interception of snow, and surface–subsurface water interactions on stream thermal regimes. This study shows that a relatively simple but process-based model can provide reasonable stream temperature predictions for forested headwater catchments located in the rain-on-snow zone.},

   abstract = {As an important GIS function, spatial interpolation is one of the most often used geographic techniques for spatial query, spatial data visualization, and spatial decision-making processes in GIS and environmental science. However, less attention has been paid on the comparisons of available spatial interpolation methods, although a number of GIS models including inverse distance weighting, spline, radial basis functions, and the typical geostatistical models (i.e. ordinary kriging, universal kriging, and cokriging) are already incorporated in GIS software packages. In this research, the conceptual and methodological aspects of regression kriging and GIS built-in interpolation models and their interpolation performance are compared and evaluated. Regression kriging is the combination of multivariate regression and kriging. It takes into consideration the spatial autocorrelation of the variable of interest, the correlation between the variable of interest and auxiliary variables (e.g., remotely sensed images are often relatively easy to obtain as auxiliary variables), and the unbiased spatial estimation with minimized variance. To assess the efficiency of regression kriging and the difference between stochastic and deterministic interpolation methods, three case studies with strong, medium, and weak correlation between the response and auxiliary variables are compared to assess interpolation performances. Results indicate that regression kriging has the potential to significantly improve spatial prediction accuracy even when using a weakly correlated auxiliary variable. © 2013 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.},

BIAs for blue whales and humpback whales are based on high concentration areas of feeding animals observed from small boat surveys, ship surveys, and opportunistic sources. These BIAs compare favorably to broader habitat-based density models. BIAs for gray whales are based on their migratory corridor as they transit between primary feeding areas located in northern latitudes and breeding areas offMexico. Additional gray whale BIAs are defined for the primary feeding areas of a smaller resident population. Two small and resident population BIAs defined for harbor porpoises located offCalifornia encompass the populations' primary areas of use. The size of the individual BIAs ranged from approximately 171 to 138,000 km2. The BIAs for feeding blue, gray, and humpback whales represent relatively small portions of the overall West Coast area (< 5%) but encompass a large majority (77 to 89%) of the thousands of sightings documented and evaluated for each species. We also evaluate and discuss potential feeding BIAs for fin whales, but none are delineated due to limited or conflicting information. The intent of identifying BIAs is to synthesize existing biological information in a transparent format that is easily accessible to scientists, managers, policymakers, and the public for use during the planning and design phase of anthropogenic activities for which U.S. statutes require the characterization and minimization of impacts on marine mammals. To maintain their utility, West Coast region BIAs should be re-evaluated and revised, if necessary, as new information becomes available.},

They are intended to provide synthesized information in a transparent format that can be readily used toward analyses and planning under U.S. statutes that require the characterization and minimization of impacts of anthropogenic activities on marine mammals. Odontocete BIAs in Hawai'i are biased toward the main Hawaiian Islands and populations offthe island of Hawai'i, reflecting a much greater level of research effort and thus certainty regarding the existence and range of small resident populations offthat island.

The common name comes from similarity not in external appearance to the killer whale (Orcinus orca) but rather in skull morphology of these two species. In fact, the two species do not appear to be closely related; based on genetic similarity , false killer whales appear to be most closely related to the Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra), pygmy killer whale (Feresa attenuata), and pilot whales (Globicephala spp.). There is evidence of geographic variation in skull morphology (Kitchener et al. , 1990), but no subspecies are currently recognized. Largely black or dark gray in color (usually with a lighter blaze on the ventral surface between the fl ippers), it is easily recognizable with its rounded head, gracile shape (Fig. 1) , small falcate dorsal fi n located at the midpoint of the back, and distinctive fl ip-pers (with a bulge on the leading edge). Scars from inter-and intra-specifi c interactions eventually are re-pigmented, unlike in the closely related Risso's dolphin. False killer whales are slightly sexually dimorphic, with the melon of males protruding farther forward than in females. Their teeth are large and conical, with 7-11 in each of the upper jaws and 8-12 in each lower jaw.},

First, we mapped Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) nighttime lights and land-use data onto the 1 km 2 grid cell system of Japan to determine the proportional areas of DMSP and urban land use within each grid cell. Then, we investigated the relationships among population density, DMSP, and urban area. The urban/built-up area was strongly positively correlated with population density, and rapid expansion of the urban/built-up area around megacities was associated with population increases. In contrast, population density dropped steeply in rural areas and in small towns. Statistical analysis showed that correlation coefficients between population density and DMSP increased as the DMSP nighttime lights brightness value increased. We next estimated population density in the Hokkaido region using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. Numerical evaluation of the results showed that the combination of land-use data and DMSP could be used to predict the population density. Finally, we compared OLS and geographically weighted regression (GWR) model for Sapporo city, Hokkaido. Compared with the OLS, the GWR can improve predictions of population density.},

   abstract = {By incorporating temporal effects into the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, an extended GWR model, geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR), has been developed to deal with both spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously in real estate market data. Unlike the standard GWR model, GTWR integrates both temporal and spatial information in the weighting matrices to capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The GTWR design embodies a local weighting scheme wherein GWR and temporally weighted regression (TWR) become special cases of GTWR. In order to test its improved performance, GTWR was compared with global ordinary least squares, TWR, and GWR in terms of goodness-of-fit and other statistical measures using a case study of residential housing sales in the city of Calgary, Canada, from 2002 to 2004. The results showed that there were substantial benefits in modeling both spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously. In the test sample, the TWR, GWR, and GTWR models, respectively, reduced absolute errors by 3.5%, 31.5%, and 46.4% relative to a global ordinary least squares model. More impressively, the GTWR model demonstrated a better goodness-of-fit (0.9282) than the TWR model (0.7794) and the GWR model (0.8897). McNamara's test supported the hypothesis that the improvements made by GTWR over the TWR and GWR models are statistically significant for the sample data. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Ordinary linear regression (OLR) is one of the most common statistical techniques used in determining the association between the outcome variable and its related factors. This method determines the association that is assumed to be true for the whole study area-a global association. In the field of public health and social sciences, this assumption is not always true, especially when it is known that the relationship between variables varies across the study area. Therefore, in such a scenario, an OLR should be calibrated in a way to account for this spatial variability. In this paper, we demonstrate use of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to account for spatial heterogeneity. In GWR, local models are reported in which association varies according to the location accounting for the local variation in variables. This technique utilizes geographical weights in determining association between the outcome variable and its related factors. These geographical weights are relatively large (i.e. close to 1) for observations located near regression point than for the observations located farther from the regression point. In this paper, we demonstrated the application of GWR and its comparison with OLR using demographic and health survey (DHS) data from Tanzania. Here we have focused on determining the association between percentages of acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children with its related factors. From OLR, we found that the percentage of female with higher education had the largest significant association with ARI (P = 0.027). On the other hand, result from the GWR returned coefficients varying from-0.15 to-0.01 (P < 0.001) over the study area in contrast to the global coefficient from OLR model. We advocate that identifying significant spatially-varying association will help policymaker to recognize the local areas of interest and design targeted interventions.},

   abstract = {Despite growing concerns for the variation of urban thermal environments and driving factors, relatively little attention has been paid to issues of spatial non-stationarity and scale-dependence, which are intrinsic properties of the urban ecosystem. In this paper, using Shenzhen City in China as a case study, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is used to explore the scale-dependent and spatial non-stationary relationships between urban land surface temperature (LST) and environmental determinants. These determinants include the distance between city and highway, patch richness density of forestland, wetland, built-up land and unused land and topographic factors such as elevation and slope aspect. For reference, the ordinary least squares (OLS) model, a global regression technique, was also employed, using the same response variable and explanatory variables as in the GWR model. The results indicate that the GWR model not only provides a better fit than the traditional OLS model, but also provides local detailed information about the spatial variation of LST, which is affected by geographical and ecological factors. With the GWR model, the strength of the regression relationships increased significantly, with a mean of 59% of the changes in the LST values explained by the predictors, compared with only 43% using the OLS model. By computing a stationarity index, one finds that different predictors have different variational trends which tend towards the stationary state with the coarsening of the spatial scale. This implies that underlying natural processes affecting the land surface temperature and its spatial pattern may operate at different spatial scales. In conclusion, the GWR model is an alternative approach to addressing spatial non-stationary and scale-dependent problems in geography and ecology. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: Several studies have assessed the relationship between exposure to natural environments (NEs) and childhood mental health and development. In most cases, a positive association has been found, but results are inconsistent, and the strength of association is unclear. This inconsistency may reflect the heterogeneity in measurements used to assess NE. Objectives: This systematic review aims to identify the most common NE metrics used in childhood mental health and development research. Our second aim is to identify the metrics that are most consistently associated with health and assess the relative strength of association depending on type of NE exposure measurement, in terms of metric used (i.e., measurement technique, such as remote sensing), but also rate (i.e., spatial and temporal exposure). Methods: We used the PRISMA protocol to identify eligible studies, following a set of pre-defined inclusion criteria based on the PECOS strategy. A number of keywords were used for retrieving relevant articles from Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, and Web of Science databases between January 2000–November 2020. From these, we extracted data on type of NE measurement and relative association to a number of indicators of childhood mental health and development. We conducted a systematic assessment of quality and risk of bias in the included articles to evaluate the level of evidence. Case studies and qualitative studies were excluded. Results: After screening of title (283 studies included), abstract, and full article, 45 studies were included in our review. A majority of which were conducted in North America and Europe (n = 36; 80%). The majority of studies used land use or land covers (LULC, n = 24; 35%) to determine exposures to NEs. Other metrics included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), expert measures (e.g., surveys of data collection done by experts), surveys (e.g., self-reported assessments), and use of NE (e.g., measures of a participant's use of NE such as through GPS tracts or parent reports). Rate was most commonly determined by buffer zones around residential addresses or postal codes. The most consistent association to health outcomes was found for buffers of 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, and within polygons boundaries (e.g., census tracts). Six health categories, academic achievement, prevalence of doctor diagnosed disorders, emotional and behavioral functioning, well-being, social functioning, and cognitive skills, were created post hoc. We found sufficient evidence between NDVI (Landsat) and emotional and behavioral well-being. Additionally, we found limited evidence between LULC datasets and academic achievement; use of NE, parent/guardian reported greenness, and expert measures of greenness and emotional and behavioral functioning; and use of NE and social functioning. Discussion: This review demonstrates that several NE measurements must be evaluated further before sufficient evidence for a potential association between distinct NE exposure metrics and childhood mental health and development can be established. Further, we suggest increased coordination between research efforts, for example, by replication of studies and comparing different NE measurements systematically, so that effect sizes can be confirmed for various health outcomes. Finally, we recommend implementing research designs that assess underlying pathways of nature-health relations and utilize measurement techniques that adequately assess exposure, access, use, and perception of NEs in order to contribute to a better understanding of health impacts of surrounding natural environments.},

K-means clustering analysis was first conducted to divide land use at each TAZ into five different patterns. Geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) models were then developed to investigate the associations between crash counts and land-use patterns. The elasticity was calculated to compare the safety effect of each explanatory factor across different patterns. The results of this study indicated that land use combinations at TAZs can be divided into different patterns using land-use mix and proportions of different land use types, and that each land use combination can be assigned with a certain safety level. The effects of contributing factors on crash frequency are different across different land-use patterns. The results suggest that proper combinations of different land uses can improve safety performance at the urban and road network planning stage.},

   abstract = {1. Introduction In line with the current information revolution, geographers increasingly make a distinction between the analysis of spatial data and spatial data analysis. While both types of analysis investigate data having geographical coordinates , the former effectively ignores the geographical component and treats the data as if they were aspatial (inter alia,Flowerdew and Green 1,994), whereas the latter makes use of the geographical component to explore explicitly spatial aspects of the data (inter alia, Anselin 1988, Besag 1986). It is this latter characteristic which makes spatial data anaiysis such a rich field for exploratory investigation. To clarify the distinction, suppose one is interested in the relation between an attribute Y and a set of attributes Xr, Xr... XN where the data all have spatial coordinates. A frequently used procedure to examine relations in such a situation is to regress Y on the set of X variables using the full data set. That is, observations from all the spatial units are used to produce a 'global' set of parameter estimates that relate the variable Y to each of the X's. In following such a procedure, a great deal of spatial information is lost in that the reiations being examined may in fact exhibit significant spatial variation which is not uncovered in the estimation of the global parameter estimates. This variation is referred to as spatial non-stationarity. In this paper, we propose an exploratory method of spatial data analysis which allows spatial variations in relations to be examined visuaily. It is useful to note at this stage that exploratory analysis is of two types: pre-confirmatory, which focusses on data accrtacy, and post-confirmatory which focusses on model accvtacy. However, neither type of exploratory analysis is exclusively dala or model-orientated. Pre-confirmatory exploratory anaiysis can be used to suggest relations to be included within a modeliing framework and post-confirmatory analysis can be useful in highlighting unusual aspects of data. The exploratory analysis described here is post-confirmatory and we are concerned with examining differences between a 'global' calibration of a model and many different 'local' calibrations. In particular, we are interested in exploring spatial variations in model calibration results. We would argue that this method has the following advantages over more conventional analysis:},

   abstract = {Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was developed in response to the finding that a regression model estimated over the entire area of interest may not adequately address local variations. The fairly simple principle on which it is based consists on estimating local models by least squares, each observation being weighted by a decreasing function of its distance to the estimation point. Combining these local models makes it possible to build a global model with specific properties. GWR can be used, in particular with the help of associated cartographic representations, to identify where local coefficients deviate the most from the overall coefficients, to build tests to assess whether the phenomenon is non-stationary and to characterise non-stationary. The method is presented using the example of a hedonic pricing model-prices of existing housing in Lyon. We show how to optimally determine the radius of the disk on which local regressions will be performed and we present the estimation results, the robust estimation methods and the tests of coefficients' non stationarity. In addition to this descriptive use, we present a more predictive approach, showing how taking non-stationarity into account makes it possible to improve an estimator over a spatial area. The example is based on a model linking the poor population and the number of beneficiaries of supplementary universal health coverage (CMU-C) in Rennes.},

This is particularly true for research focused on the evaluation of adaptive forest management strategies. In this study, we developed an application, ClimateAP, to generate scale-free (i.e., specific to point locations) climate data for historical (1901-2015) and future (2011-2100) years and periods. ClimateAP uses the best available interpolated climate data for the reference period 1961- 1990 as baseline data. It downscales the baseline data from a moderate spatial resolution to scale-free point data through dynamic local elevation adjustments. It also integrates and downscales the historical and future climate data using a delta approach. In the case of future climate data, two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and 15 general circulation models are included to allow for the assessment of alternative climate scenarios. In addition, ClimateAP generates a large number of biologically relevant climate variables derived from primary monthly variables. The effectiveness of the local downscaling was determined based on the strength of the local linear regression for the estimate of lapse rate. The accuracy of the ClimateAP output was evaluated through comparisons of ClimateAP output against observations from 1805 weather stations in the Asia Pacific region. The local linear regression explained 70%-80% and 0%-50% of the total variation in monthly temperatures and precipitation, respectively, in most cases. ClimateAP reduced prediction error by up to 27% and 60% for monthly temperature and precipitation, respectively, relative to the original baselines data. The improvements for baseline portions of historical and future were more substantial. Applications and limitations of the software are discussed.},

   abstract = {Projecting future distributions of ecosystems or species climate niches has widely been used to assess the potential impacts of climate change. However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

ClimateNA covers 1) 104 years of historical data (1901-2014) in monthly, annual, decadal and 30-year time steps; 2) three paleoclimatic periods (Last Glacial Maximum, Mid Holocene and Last Millennium); 3) three future periods (2020s, 2050s and 2080s); and 4) annual time-series of model projections for 2011-2100. Multiple general circulation models (GCMs) were included for both paleo and future periods, and two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and 8.5) were chosen for future climate data.},

   abstract = {Various forms of machine learning (ML) methods have historically played a valuable role in environmental remote sensing research. With an increasing amount of “big data” from earth observation and rapid advances in ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed. Finally, challenges and future perspectives will be comprehensively analyzed and discussed.},

   abstract = {The area of land use or land cover change obtained directly from a map may differ greatly from the true area of change because of map classification error. An error-adjusted estimator of area can be easily produced once an accuracy assessment has been performed and an error matrix constructed. The estimator presented is a stratified estimator which is applicable to data acquired using popular sampling designs such as stratified random, simple random and systematic (the stratified estimator is often labeled a poststratified estimator for the latter two designs). A confidence interval for the area of land change should also be provided to quantify the uncertainty of the change area estimate. The uncertainty of the change area estimate, as expressed via the confidence interval, can then subsequently be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis for applications using land change area as an input (e.g., a carbon flux model). Accuracy assessments published for land change studies should report the information required to produce the stratified estimator of change area and to construct confidence intervals. However, an evaluation of land change articles published between 2005 and 2010 in two remote sensing journals revealed that accuracy assessments often fail to include this key information. We recommend that land change maps should be accompanied by an accuracy assessment that includes a clear description of the sampling design (including sample size and, if relevant, details of stratification), an error matrix, the area or proportion of area of each category according to the map, and descriptive accuracy measures such as user's, producer's and overall accuracy. Furthermore, mapped areas should be adjusted to eliminate bias attributable to map classification error and these error-adjusted area estimates should be accompanied by confidence intervals to quantify the sampling variability of the estimated area. Using data from the published literature, we illustrate how to produce error-adjusted point estimates and confidence intervals of land change areas. A simple analysis of uncertainty based on the confidence bounds for land change area is applied to a carbon flux model to illustrate numerically that variability in the land change area estimate can have a dramatic effect on model outputs. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Spatial variability in a crop field creates a need for precision agriculture. Economical and rapid means of identifying spatial variability is obtained through the use of geotechnology (remotely sensed images of the crop field, image processing, GIS modeling approach, and GPS usage) and data mining techniques for model development. Higher-end image processing techniques are followed to establish more precision. The goal of this paper was to investigate the strength of key spectral vegetation indices for agricultural crop yield prediction using neural network techniques. Four widely used spectral indices were investigated in a study of irrigated corn crop yields in the Oakes Irrigation Test Area research site of North Dakota, USA. These indices were: (a) red and near-infrared (NIR) based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), (b) green and NIR based green vegetation index (GVI), (c) red and NIR based soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and (d) red and NIR based perpendicular vegetation index (PVI). These four indices were investigated for corn yield during 3 years (1998, 1999, and 2001) and for the pooled data of these 3 years. Initially, Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models were developed, including 16 models (4 indices * 4 years including the data from the pooled years) to test for the efficiency determination of those four vegetation indices in corn crop yield prediction. The corn yield was best predicted using BPNN models that used the means and standard deviations of PVI grid images. In all three years, it provided higher prediction accuracies, coefficient of determination (r2), and lower standard error of prediction than the models involving GVI, NDVI, and SAVI image information. The GVI, NDVI, and SAVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 24.26% to 94.85%, 19.36% to 95.04%, and 19.24% to 95.04%, respectively while the PVI models for all three years provided average testing prediction accuracies of 83.50% to 96.04%. The PVI pool model provided better average testing prediction accuracy of 94% with respect to other vegetation models, for which it ranged from 89-93%. Similarly, the PVI pool model provided coefficient of determination (r2) value of 0.45 as compared to 0.31-0.37 for other index models. Log10 data transformation technique was used to enhance the prediction ability of the PVI models of years 1998, 1999, and 2001 as it was chosen as the preferred index. Another model (Transformed PVI (Pool)) was developed using the log10 transformed PVI image information to show its global application. The transformed PVI models provided average corn yield prediction accuracies of 90%, 97%, and 98% for years 1998, 1999, and 2001, respectively. The pool PVI transformed model provided as average testing accuracy of 93% along with r2 value of 0.72 and standard error of prediction of 0.05 t/ha. © 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.},

Boreal forests represent an excellent case study for such research because these forests have undergone significant changes over recent decades. We analyzed the temporal trends of four widely-used landscape pattern indices for boreal forests of Canada: forest cover, largest forest patch index, forest edge density, and core (interior) forest cover. The indices were computed over landscape extents ranging from 5,000 ha (n = 18,185) to 50,000 ha (n = 1,662) and across nine major ecozones of Canada. We used 26 years of Landsat satellite imagery to derive annualized trends of the landscape pattern indices. The largest declines in forest cover, largest forest patch index, and core forest cover were observed in the Boreal Shield, Boreal Plain, and Boreal Cordillera ecozones. Forest edge density increased at all landscape extents for all ecozones. Rapidly changing landscapes, defined as the 90th percentile of forest cover change, were among the most forested initially and were characterized by four times greater decrease in largest forest patch index, three times greater increase in forest edge density, and four times greater decrease in core forest cover compared with all 50,000 ha landscapes. Moreover, approximately 18% of all 50,000 ha landscapes did not change due to a lack of disturbance. The pattern database results provide important context for forest management agencies committed to implementing ecosystem-based management strategies.},

   abstract = {Modeling and mapping the climatic niches of forest tree species and projecting their potential shift in geographic distribution under future climates are essential steps in assessing the impact of climate change on forests and in developing adaptive forest management strategies. It is particularly important for selecting suitable tree species to match future climates for afforestation and restoration of forest ecosystems. Large scale afforestation and reforestation projects have occurred or planned in Asia-Pacific region; however, the direct impact of climate change has not been widely considered. This has been at least partially due to the lack of availability of robust inventory data on forest vegetation and lack of access to appropriate climate data. In this study, we used our recently developed model, ClimateAP, to generate a large number of climate variables for point locations and used an ensemble modeling approach with Random Forest to overcome some limitations that exist with vegetation data. Uncertainty in future climates was incorporated into the analysis through consensus based projections using 12 climate change scenarios. We modeled the climatic niches for four economically and ecologically important forest tree species in the region and projected their shift in geographical distribution under climate change. Unusual patterns in the shift of geographic distributions of climatic niches were found in two species in Southern China. The implications of the projections in forest management for adaptation to climate change are discussed.},

Soil moisture and snow water equivalent are two quantities that play a major role in these applications. In this paper an algorithm for hydrological purposes (called hereinafter HydroAlgo), which is able to generate maps of snow depth (SD) and soil moisture content (SMC) from AMSR-E data, has been developed and implemented within the framework of the JAXA ADEOS-II/AMSR-E and GCOM/AMSR-2 programs, as well as of a project of the Italian Space Agency that is devoted to civil protection from floods and landslides. As auxiliary output, the algorithm also generates maps of vegetation biomass (VB). An initial phase of pre-processing includes the improvement of spatial resolution, as well as masking for urban areas, water bodies, and dense vegetation. The algorithm was then split into two branches, the first of which focused on the retrieval of SMC and the second, on SD. Both parameters were retrieved using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. The algorithm was calibrated using a wide set of experimental data collected on three sites: Mongolia and Australia (for SMC), and Siberia (for SD), integrated with model simulations. These results were then validated by comparing the algorithm outputs with experimental data collected on two additional sites: a part of a watershed in Northern Italy, and a large portion of Scandinavia. An additional test of the algorithm was also performed on a large scale, and included sites characterized by differing climatic and meteorological conditions. © Author(s) 2013.},

Litter decomposition was slowest in dry biogeoclimatic zones and fastest in wet zones. Overall, it appears that moisture is more limiting than temperature for litter decomposition across British Columbia. The effect of clearcutting on litter decomposition rates varied among forest types. Province-wide, mass loss of pine needle litter was significantly slower in clearcuts than in adjacent forests, but this difference disappeared after 3 years. Aspen leaves and forest floor material decomposed at similar rates in forests and clearcuts. Decomposition of broadleaf litter was slightly faster than needle litter during the first 2 years, but slowed in subsequent years. After 3 years there was no significant difference between the mass remaining for broadleaf and conifer litter. In N-fertilized plots, higher N concentrations did not affect the rate of decay in litter or in forest floors. Many of our beliefs about litter decomposition and influences of forestry practices thereon should be revised in light of new empirical evidence.},

We found that the degree-days below zero and mean annual precipitation were the most important climatic factors, while the basic soil saturation, soil gravel volume percentage, and clay content were the main soil factors, determining the suitable habitats of C. acuminata. We found that suitable habitats of this species would moderately increase in future climates under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. However, substantial shifts among levels of habitat suitability were projected. The dual high-suitable habitats would expand, which would be favorable for commercial plantations.

   abstract = {Aim: Rising atmospheric CO 2 and climate warming have induced changes in tree growth and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) world-wide, but the long-term impact of such changes on terrestrial productivity remains unknown. Based on a synthesis of the literature, here we investigate the net impact of recent atmospheric changes across forest biomes. Location: A range of sites covering major forest biomes. Methods: We use dendrochronological and isotopic records to provide an integrated analysis of changes in growth and iWUE, evaluating the impacts of atmospheric changes in tree growth. In our analysis, positive relationships between changes in growth and iWUE reflect CO 2 stimulation, while neutral effects yield inflections in growth curves (plotted against iWUE), and negative relationships indicate the prevalence of stressors. To estimate net effects (since 1960) and compare responses across biomes, we use a response contrast (RC) index, based on the ratio between cumulative changes in growth and iWUE. Results: In 37 recently published case studies changes in iWUE were consistently positive, increasing by between 10 and 60%, but shifts in growth varied widely within and among forest biomes. Positive RC values were observed in high latitudes (>40°N), while progressively lower (always negative) responses were observed toward lower latitudes. Growth rates declined between 15 and 55% in tropical forests. In subtropical sites growth declined by between 7 and 10%, while mixed responses occurred in other regions. Main conclusions: Over the past 50 years, tree growth decline has prevailed despite increasing atmospheric CO 2. The impact of atmospheric changes on forest productivity is latitude dependent (R 2=0.9, P<0.05), but our results suggest that, globally, CO 2 stimulation of mature trees will not counteract emissions. In most surveyed case studies warming-induced stress was evoked to explain growth decline, but other factors, such as nutrient limitation, could have overridden the potential benefits of rising CO 2 levels. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Forest ecosystems are critical to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration. However, climate change has affected forest ecosystem functioning in both negative and positive ways, and has led to shifts in species/functional diversity and losses in plant species diversity which may impair the positive effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning. Biodiversity may mitigate climate change impacts on (I) biodiversity itself, as more-diverse systems could be more resilient to climate change impacts, and (II) ecosystem functioning through the positive relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. By surveying the literature, we examined how climate change has affected forest ecosystem functioning and plant diversity. Based on the biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning (B→EF), we specifically address the potential for biodiversity to mitigate climate change impacts on forest ecosystem functioning. For this purpose, we formulate a concept whereby biodiversity may reduce the negative impacts or enhance the positive impacts of climate change on ecosystem functioning. Further B→EF studies on climate change in natural forests are encouraged to elucidate how biodiversity might influence ecosystem functioning. This may be achieved through the detailed scrutiny of large spatial/long temporal scale data sets, such as long-term forest inventories. Forest management strategies based on B→EF have strong potential for augmenting the effectiveness of the roles of forests in the mitigation of climate change impacts on ecosystem functioning.},

   abstract = {This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks. Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged. Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Understanding the distribution and productivity of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) under climate change is critical given the ecological and economic importance of the species. Recently, process-based growth models have grown in their popularity given their simplicity and data availability, and they are increasingly being used to map the distribution and productivity of tree species. In this paper, we study the extent of variation of the current range shift and the productivity of the species under a changing climate. We used the Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth (3-PG) model, which calculates the extent to which climatic variables affect photosynthesis and growth of a species. These variables were then used in a decision-tree model to develop rules to provide a basis for predicting the distribution of the species under current climatic conditions. Once the distribution model was developed the productivity of the species was then assessed. Using climate projections we then simulated the growth and distribution into the future. Results indicate a northward shift from the current range. The growth model also indicates minor increases in productivity in some of the existing distribution areas, principally in central China with limited productivity predicted in newly emerged stands. We conclude that this dual modeling approach has potential to quantify impacts of climate change on selected species and examining differences in climate projections on range and productivity estimation.},

   abstract = {Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) is not only a valuable timber species, but also plays an important role in the provision of ecosystem services. Forest management decisions to increase the production of fiber for economic gain may have negative impacts on the long-term flow of ecosystem services from forest resources. Such tradeoffs should be taken into account to fulfill the requirements of sustainable forest management. Here we employed an established, ecosystem-based, stand-level model (FORECAST) in combination with a simplified harvest-scheduling model to evaluate the potential tradeoffs among indicators of provisional, regulating and supporting ecosystem services in a Chinese-fir-dominated landscape located in Fujian Province as a case study. Indicators included: merchantable volume harvested, biomass harvested, ecosystem carbon storage, CO2 fixation, O2 released, biomass nitrogen content, pollutant absorption, and soil fertility. A series of alternative management scenarios, representing different combinations of rotation length and harvest intensity, were simulated to facilitate the analysis. Results from the analysis were summarized in the form of a decision matrix designed to provide a method for forest managers to evaluate management alternatives and tradeoffs in the context of key indicators of ecosystem services. The scenario analysis suggests that there are considerable tradeoffs in terms of ecosystem services associated with stand and landscape-level management decisions. Longer rotations and increased retention tended to favor regulating and supporting services while the opposite was true for provisional services.},

   abstract = {Traits that enable species to persist in ecological environments are often maintained over time, a phenomenon known as niche conservatism. Here we argue that ecological niches function at levels above species, notably at the level of genus for mammals, and that niche conservatism is also evident above the species level. Using the proxy of geographic range size, we explore changes in the realized niche of North American mammalian genera and families across the major climatic transition represented by the last glacial-interglacial transition. We calculate the mean and variance of range size for extant mammalian genera and families, rank them by range size, and estimate the change in range size and rank during the late Pleistocene and late Holocene. We demonstrate that range size at the genus and family levels was surprisingly constant over this period despite range shifts and extinctions of species within the clades. We suggest that underlying controls on niche conservatism may be different at these higher taxonomic levels than at the species level. Niche conservatism at higher levels seems primarily controlled by intrinsic life history traits, whereas niche conservatism at the species level may reflect underlying environmental controls. These results highlight the critical importance of conserving the biodiversity of mammals at the genus level and of maintaining an adequate species pool within genera. climate change extinction geographic range size mammals Pleistocene T he distributions of mammals are labile over ecological time and have been impacted by human activities, including climatic warming over the past century (1-6). Although humans are altering the distribution of Earth's species in our lifetimes (7), we have little information about how extant species and higher taxa altered their distributions in the past. Here we examine the fossil record for variation in the distribution of mammalian ranges at the level of genus and families in response to climatic change over an evolutionary and ecological relevant time scale (tens of thousands of years). The goal is to understand whether niche conservatism is evident at taxonomic levels higher than species and, if so, what actually underlies the conservation of a niche through long time periods. Nearly all previous studies of niche conservatism have been at the level of species. The distribution of a species can be defined as the environmental space in which the species has a positive intrinsic growth rate (8). Predictions using the climatic envelope around this distribution are used to project species occurrence in geographic space into the future given modeled climates, typically over decades to centuries (i.e., ref 9). The models are based on the premise that niches are ''conserved,'' or that species retain suites of inherited traits valuable for survival in the habitats in which they presently are found (10). Practically, these models thus presume that the distribution of a species today encompasses the entire potential range of environments in which it could survive and, by inference, that the species is close to occupying its fundamental niche (11). By using historic distribution data, climatic envelope models also may be used to hindcast niche occupancy to investigate whether the distribution of ranges has, in fact, varied through time (12). Hindcasting models have the possibility of independently verifying climatic reconstructions with species occurrences and thus can be quite powerful (see ref. 12 for a recent summary). Support for the conservation of niches comes from documented relationships between species distributions and environmental variables (13). Species distributions, or their geographic range boundaries, that change in response to environmental shifts represent one predictive outcome of niche conservatism (e.g., poleward expansion of species with warmer temperatures, ref. 14). Indeed, records of fossil mammal distributions show that ranges of individual species moved coincident with the timing of late Pleistocene (LP) warming (3, 4), and boundaries changed in the direction expected. Some extant species have shown rapid change in their range boundaries, depending on climate (e.g., refs. 5, 15), and invasive species can show continental-scale range expansions within decades [e.g., house sparrow (Passer domes-ticus, ref. 16) and cane toad (Bufo marinus, ref. 17)]. The geographic ranges of species today encompass a suite of environments that the species occupies now [the realized niche (18)] but not necessarily all environments that the species could potentially inhabit [the fundamental niche, (11)], as evidenced by the enormous number of invasive species, previously limited only by dispersal barriers. Despite much debate, it is unclear to what extent species generally occupy fundamental versus realized niches (8). Ultimately, the assumption that underlies the concept of phylogenetic niche conservatism at the species level is that the geographic distribution is a proxy for the realized niche in a Grinnellian sense (8), and that it results from interactions between the (i) environment (both abiotic and biotic) and (ii) species-inherited traits [predominately physiological and morphological (19, 20)]. For clarity of discussion, in this article, we refer to these two types of niche-defining variables as ''environment-based'' and ''trait-based,'' respectively. From a trait-based perspective, closely related species share more inherited traits than those more distantly related, so the controls on the geographic range of closely related species should be similar (21, 22). The same logic applies to environment-based controls. In fact, recent studies bear this out: Many traits, from body size to behavioral traits, show strong phylogenetic signal (24). Phylogenetic signal was also found in a study of range size in primates, carnivores, and artiodactyls (25). Because of such geographic-range similarities between closely related species, it also follows that the aggregate ranges of congeneric species define the ecological niche of a genus (or any},

   abstract = {Projecting future distributions of ecosystems or species climate niches has widely been used to assess the potential impacts of climate change. However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Results of this study suggest that new methods for anchoring population response functions, and a multivariate approach for incorporating climate variables into a single model, considerably improve the reliability of these functions. These functions identified a small number of populations in central areas of the species distribution with greater growth potential over a wide range of mean annual temperature (MAT). Average productivity of lodgepole pine is predicted to increase (up to 7%) if moderate warming (∼2 °C MAT) occurs in the next few decades as predicted, although productivity would substantially decline in some SPUs in southern BC. Severe global warming (>3 °C MAT) would result in either a drastic decline in productivity or local populations being extirpated in southern SPUs. New deployment strategies using the best seed sources for future reforestation may not only be able to mitigate the negative impact of global warming, but may even be able to increase productivity in some areas. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Twelve populations were collected across an altitudinal gradient (1650-2520 m above sea level [asl]) in a mountainous zone in the central-west region of the Mexican Trans-Volcanic Belt, and were planted in common garden tests at three forest sites of different altitudes (low: 2110, medium: 2422 and upper: 2746 m asl). Climate was estimated using a spline climatic model at the seed source and test sites and also measured using in situ data loggers. Survivorship and seedling height were evaluated in the field during the second and third growing seasons. Results were analyzed using mixed models to include the effect of climatic transfer distances (difference in climate between seed source and test site). Significant differences were found in seedling growth among Pinus devoniana, P. pseudostrobus and P. leiophylla, and among populations within the former two species. These were associated primarily with climatic transfer distances of extreme temperatures (minimum temperature in the coldest month and mean temperature in the warmest month). There was a significant decrease in growth in P. devoniana when the transfer exceeded 650 m of upward altitudinal shift or a reduction of 1.58C with transfer to colder sites. There was also a decrease of growth in P. pseudostrobus when transfer exceeded 400 m of upward altitudinal shift or 1.58C, with a significant decrease in survivorship. Pinus leiophylla, however, exhibited similar growth at all altitudes tested, probably due to phenotypic plasticity. Although further research is required with field tests using commercial spacing and trees of older ages, the results suggest that an assisted upwards migration of 300 m in altitude, in order to approach a realignment of the populations to the climate projected for the decade centered around the year 2030, appears to be a viable strategy with which to accommodate the effects of climate change.},

However, empirical estimates of the effectiveness of this private adaptation are scarce and the sensitivity of impact assessments to adaptation assumptions is not well understood 1,2. Here we assess the potential effectiveness of private farmer adaptation in Europe by jointly estimating both short-run and long-run response functions using time-series and cross-sectional variation in subnational yield and profit data. The difference between the impacts of climate change projected using the short-run (limited adaptation) and long-run (substantial adaptation) response curves can be interpreted as the private adaptation potential. We find high adaptation potential for maize to future warming but large negative effects and only limited adaptation potential for wheat and barley. Overall, agricultural profits could increase slightly under climate change if farmers adapt but could decrease in many areas if there is no adaptation. Decomposing the variance in 2040 projected yields and farm profits using an ensemble of 13 climate model runs, we find that the rate at which farmers will adapt to rising temperatures is an important source of uncertainty. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This is particularly true for research focused on the evaluation of adaptive forest management strategies. In this study, we developed an application, ClimateAP, to generate scale-free (i.e., specific to point locations) climate data for historical (1901-2015) and future (2011-2100) years and periods. ClimateAP uses the best available interpolated climate data for the reference period 1961- 1990 as baseline data. It downscales the baseline data from a moderate spatial resolution to scale-free point data through dynamic local elevation adjustments. It also integrates and downscales the historical and future climate data using a delta approach. In the case of future climate data, two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and 15 general circulation models are included to allow for the assessment of alternative climate scenarios. In addition, ClimateAP generates a large number of biologically relevant climate variables derived from primary monthly variables. The effectiveness of the local downscaling was determined based on the strength of the local linear regression for the estimate of lapse rate. The accuracy of the ClimateAP output was evaluated through comparisons of ClimateAP output against observations from 1805 weather stations in the Asia Pacific region. The local linear regression explained 70%-80% and 0%-50% of the total variation in monthly temperatures and precipitation, respectively, in most cases. ClimateAP reduced prediction error by up to 27% and 60% for monthly temperature and precipitation, respectively, relative to the original baselines data. The improvements for baseline portions of historical and future were more substantial. Applications and limitations of the software are discussed.},

Large scale afforestation and reforestation projects have occurred or planned in Asia-Pacific region; however, the direct impact of climate change has not been widely considered.

Site-specific forest management requires an accurate estimation of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, and information about the spatial distribution of SOC stocks is essential for improving the soil quality and ecosystem productivity. We examined the spatial distribution of SOC stocks using 91 soil samples from Masson pine forests in subtropical China. Ordinary kriging (OK) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) methods were used to compare the spatial patterns of the SOC stocks. A moderate spatial dependence of the SOC stocks suggested that extrinsic and intrinsic factors affected the SOC stocks. Similar spatial distributions but different cross-validation accuracies indicated that OK outperformed IDW. The soil pools at a depth of 0–60 cm were 774.06 Gg and 761.61 Gg as determined by the OK and IDW methods, respectively, which were higher than that measured by the conventional method (CM, 734.22 Gg). This highlights the need to apply different methods when studying the regional SOC pools. On the basis of the comparison of OK, IDW, and CM methods, OK is recommended for determining nonhomogeneous sampling point distributions. The present results enhance our understanding of method selection when studying the spatial distribution of SOC stocks.},

   abstract = {While low-to-moderate resolution gridded climate data are suitable for climate-impact modeling at global and ecosystems levels, spatial analyses conducted at local scales require climate data with increased spatial accuracy. This is particularly true for research focused on the evaluation of adaptive forest management strategies. In this study, we developed an application, ClimateAP, to generate scale-free (i.e., specific to point locations) climate data for historical (1901-2015) and future (2011-2100) years and periods. ClimateAP uses the best available interpolated climate data for the reference period 1961- 1990 as baseline data. It downscales the baseline data from a moderate spatial resolution to scale-free point data through dynamic local elevation adjustments. It also integrates and downscales the historical and future climate data using a delta approach. In the case of future climate data, two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and 15 general circulation models are included to allow for the assessment of alternative climate scenarios. In addition, ClimateAP generates a large number of biologically relevant climate variables derived from primary monthly variables. The effectiveness of the local downscaling was determined based on the strength of the local linear regression for the estimate of lapse rate. The accuracy of the ClimateAP output was evaluated through comparisons of ClimateAP output against observations from 1805 weather stations in the Asia Pacific region. The local linear regression explained 70%-80% and 0%-50% of the total variation in monthly temperatures and precipitation, respectively, in most cases. ClimateAP reduced prediction error by up to 27% and 60% for monthly temperature and precipitation, respectively, relative to the original baselines data. The improvements for baseline portions of historical and future were more substantial. Applications and limitations of the software are discussed.},

   abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

   abstract = {Modeling and mapping the climatic niches of forest tree species and projecting their potential shift in geographic distribution under future climates are essential steps in assessing the impact of climate change on forests and in developing adaptive forest management strategies. It is particularly important for selecting suitable tree species to match future climates for afforestation and restoration of forest ecosystems. Large scale afforestation and reforestation projects have occurred or planned in Asia-Pacific region; however, the direct impact of climate change has not been widely considered. This has been at least partially due to the lack of availability of robust inventory data on forest vegetation and lack of access to appropriate climate data. In this study, we used our recently developed model, ClimateAP, to generate a large number of climate variables for point locations and used an ensemble modeling approach with Random Forest to overcome some limitations that exist with vegetation data. Uncertainty in future climates was incorporated into the analysis through consensus based projections using 12 climate change scenarios. We modeled the climatic niches for four economically and ecologically important forest tree species in the region and projected their shift in geographical distribution under climate change. Unusual patterns in the shift of geographic distributions of climatic niches were found in two species in Southern China. The implications of the projections in forest management for adaptation to climate change are discussed.},

A software package, ClimateWNA, allows users to access the database and query point locations, obtain time series, or generate custom climate surfaces at any resolution. The software uses partial derivative functions of temperature change along elevation gradients to improve medium-resolution baseline climate estimates and calculates biologically relevant climate variables such as growing degree-days, number of frost-free days, extreme temperatures, and dryness indices. Historical and projected future climates are obtained by using monthly temperature and precipitation anomalies to adjust the interpolated baseline data for the location of interest. All algorithms used in the software package are described and evaluated against observations from weather stations across WNA. The downscaling algorithms substantially improve the accuracy of temperature variables over the medium-resolution baseline climate surfaces.

   abstract = {Projecting future distributions of ecosystems or species climate niches has widely been used to assess the potential impacts of climate change. However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

We found that the degree-days below zero and mean annual precipitation were the most important climatic factors, while the basic soil saturation, soil gravel volume percentage, and clay content were the main soil factors, determining the suitable habitats of C. acuminata. We found that suitable habitats of this species would moderately increase in future climates under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. However, substantial shifts among levels of habitat suitability were projected. The dual high-suitable habitats would expand, which would be favorable for commercial plantations. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of climate change on this species and provide a scientific basis for the cultivation and conservation purposes.},

Estimates of climate variables were validated using an independent dataset from weather stations that were not included in the development of the model. Weather station records generally agreed well with estimated climate variables and showed significant improvements over original PRISM climate data. A stand-alone MS Windows application was developed to perform all calculations and to integrate future climate predictions from various global circulation models.

Simulation models are being developed and used to project the effects of global climatic change, i.e., the greenhouse effect, on the dynamics and pattern of vegetation. Many models use information about species' current ranges relative to climatic variables, i.e., their realized niche, to derive response functions. Using a simulation model for Californian chaparral, we compare the projections of vegetation using response functions representing a calculated realized niche and an assumed fundamental niche. The realized niche response functions are based on the distributions of species along gradients of annual precipitation and mean temperatures of the coldest and warmest months. Then, assuming that moderate increases in precipitation (as projected by some general circulation models for Californian chaparral) will reduce stress, we modified the functions to produce assumed fundamental niche responses. Compared to the projections based on the realized niche, use of the fundamental niche produces more continuous cover, lags in change, and different dominance following climatic change. The effects of increased precipitation per se are lasting using the realized niche responses, but only temporary using the assumed fundamental niche responses. More detailed information on actual responses is needed, but the physiological information now available would be useful only in models that would consume vast computing resources.},

   abstract = {Ecological regionalization is a base for rational management and sustainable utilization of ecosystems and natural resources. It can provide a scientific basis for constructing healthy ecological environments and making policies of environmental management. In this paper, based on synthetic analysis of the characteristics of the ecology and environments of China, the principles of ecological regionalization are discussed, and indices and nomenclature of ecological regionalization are proposed. The ecoregions on a national scale are divided. The results show that there are 3 domains, 13 ecoregions and 57 ecodistricts. The present scheme can be used as a framework for ecosystem assessment and management. Based on the ecoregions, measurements of management for forest, grassland, agriculture and wetland ecosystems are recommended. The experience and information can be used within and beyond the national scale for land-use planning, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Floristic compositions of non-endemic plants of continental islands were related to the neighboring continents because non-endemic plant species had historically migrated to continental islands from source areas. This study attempts to identify source areas of a continental island by means of floristic analysis and to assess possible migration routes on the basis of geographical distribution ranges of plants. Large quantities of angiosperm data records were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Similarity index and cluster analysis were used to identify the floristic similarities among 22 geographical localities of Taiwan (GLTs) and 34 terrestrial ecoregions in Asia. Geographical distribution ranges of non-endemic angiosperm species in Taiwan (NEASTs) were evaluated to mirror the possible migration routes from different source areas to Taiwan. There are 3275 angiosperm species in Taiwan derived from the dataset of GBIF. Among them, 847 are endemic and 2428 are NEASTs. Geographical distribution ranges of the 2428 NEASTs were categorized into 7 distribution groups. They were widely distribution from equator to Siberia (27 species), tropical ecoregions (345 species), tropical and subtropical ecoregions (663 species), tropical to temperate ecoregions (591 species), subtropical ecoregions (265 species), subtropical to temperate ecoregions (387 species), and temperate ecoregions (150 species). Results of similarity indices and cluster analysis demonstrated that high floristic similarities were observed among GLTs at lowland and southern Taiwan and tropical and subtropical ecoregions in Asia. GLTs at high mountains were assumed to have floristic similarity with temperate ecoregions in Asia, whereas the assumption was not supported by our analysis. It is partly because of that angiosperms with tropical and subtropical distributions extend their ranges from low to high elevations in Taiwan. Subtropical ecoregions at southern China and tropical ecoregions at Indochina were more important than temperate ecoregions on playing source areas of NEASTs. Geographical distribution ranges of NEASTs implied that most of the NEASTs were probably migrated from topical or subtropical ecoregions of Asian continent to Taiwan.},

Conservation efforts focus on measuring species diversity and distribution, assessing biodiversity threats, and managing habitats to maintain that diversity. The accuracy of measuring species diversity depends on the quality and scale of the data. Recently indirect estimates of diversity based on the skilled opinions of international taxonomic authorities were used to define 25 global conservation hotspots [Myers et al. (2000) Nature 403: 853-858] and 871 ecoregions [Olson et al. (2001) Bioscience 51: 933-938]. These data, originating from first-hand fieldwork and museum study, are readily available, but not necessarily repeatable nor testable. If this type of information prevails for conservation purposes, it is critical that we test the quality of this information with verifiable data at finer scales (e.g., regional inventories, specimen records, and accumulated distribution data). Here we perform such a test for the hotspots and ecoregions found in the Indo-Pacific by comparing the estimates of the expert scientists with authenticated published diversity data on flowering plants. We found a high correlation between our counts of species richness and endemism with the experts' estimates, but surprisingly found less congruity among the seven families examined.

However, AGF may cause outbreeding depression (especially if source and recipient populations have been long isolated) and may disrupt local adaptation to nonclimatic factors. Selection should eliminate extrinsic outbreeding depression due to adaptive differences in large populations, and simulations suggest that, within a few generations, evolution should resolve mild intrinsic outbreeding depression due to epistasis. To weigh the risks of AGF against those of maladaptation due to climate change, we need to know the species' extent of local adaptation to climate and other environmental factors, as well as its pattern of gene flow. AGF should be a powerful tool for managing foundation and resource-producing species with large populations and broad ranges that show signs of historical adaptation to local climatic conditions. © Copyright ©2013 by Annual Reviews.

   abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

This study surveys experts in forestry and climate change from the Asia–Pacific region to gauge their perspectives on the impacts of climate change and on the challenges faced by forest adaptation in the region, and explores recommendations and initiatives for adapting forests to climate change. There was consensus regarding the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems and on economic sectors such as agriculture and forestry. Respondents also indicated a lack of public awareness and policy and legislation as challenges to addressing climate change. However, the results indicate differences in opinion between regions on the negative impacts of climate change and in satisfaction with actions taken to address climate change, highlighting the need for locally specific policies and research. The study presents specific recommendations to address issues of most concern, based on subregion and professional affiliation throughout the Asia–Pacific region. The results can be used to improve policy and forest management throughout the region. This research will also provide valuable suggestions on how to apply research findings and management recommendations outside of the AP region. The conclusions should be communicated relative to the level of the research and the target audience, ensuring that scientific findings and management recommendations are effectively communicated to ensure successful implementation of forest adaptation strategies.},

   abstract = {The Sino-Japanese Floristic Region (SJFR) of East Asia harbors the most diverse of the world's temperate flora, and was the most important glacial refuge for its Tertiary representatives ('relics') throughout Quaternary ice-age cycles. A steadily increasing number of phylogeographic studies in the SJFR of mainland China and adjacent areas, including the Qinghai-Tibetan-Plateau (QTP) and Sino-Himalayan region, have documented the population histories of temperate plant species in these regions. Here we review this current literature that challenges the oft-stated view of the SJFR as a glacial sanctuary for temperate plants, instead revealing profound effects of Quaternary changes in climate, topography, and/or sea level on the current genetic structure of such organisms. There are three recurrent phylogeographic scenarios identified by different case studies that broadly agree with longstanding biogeographic or palaeo-ecological hypotheses: (i) postglacial re-colonization of the QTP from (south-)eastern glacial refugia; (ii) population isolation and endemic species formation in Southwest China due to tectonic shifts and river course dynamics; and (iii) long-term isolation and species survival in multiple localized refugia of (warm-)temperate deciduous forest habitats in subtropical (Central/East/South) China. However, in four additional instances, phylogeographic findings seem to conflict with a priori predictions raised by palaeo-data, suggesting instead: (iv) glacial in situ survival of some hardy alpine herbs and forest trees on the QTP platform itself; (v) long-term refugial isolation of (warm-)temperate evergreen taxa in subtropical China; (vi) 'cryptic' glacial survival of (cool-)temperate deciduous forest trees in North China; and (vii) unexpectedly deep (Late Tertiary/early-to-mid Pleistocene) allopatric-vicariant differentiation of disjunct lineages in the East China-Japan-Korea region due to past sea transgressions. We discuss these and other consequences of the main phylogeographic findings in light of palaeo-environmental evidence, emphasize notable gaps in our knowledge, and outline future research prospects for disentangling the evolution and biogeographic history of the region's extremely diverse temperate flora. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Wildland fire is a critical process in forests of the western United States (US). Variation in fire behavior, which is heavily influenced by fuel loading, terrain, weather, and vegetation type, leads to heterogeneity in fire severity across landscapes. The relative influence of these factors in driving fire severity, however, is poorly understood. Here, we explore the drivers of high-severity fire for forested ecoregions in the western US over the period 2002-2015. Fire severity was quantified using a satellite-inferred index of severity, the relativized burn ratio. For each ecoregion, we used boosted regression trees to model high-severity fire as a function of live fuel, topography, climate, and fire weather. We found that live fuel, on average, was the most important factor driving high-severity fire among ecoregions (average relative influence = 53.1%) and was the most important factor in 14 of 19 ecoregions. Fire weather was the second most important factor among ecoregions (average relative influence = 22.9%) and was the most important factor in five ecoregions. Climate (13.7%) and topography (10.3%) were less influential. We also predicted the probability of high-severity fire, were a fire to occur, using recent (2016) satellite imagery to characterize live fuel for a subset of ecoregions in which the model skill was deemed acceptable (n = 13). These 'wall-to-wall' gridded ecoregional maps provide relevant and up-to-date information for scientists and managers who are tasked with managing fuel and wildland fire. Lastly, we provide an example of the predicted likelihood of high-severity fire under moderate and extreme fire weather before and after fuel reduction treatments, thereby demonstrating how our framework and model predictions can potentially serve as a performance metric for land management agencies tasked with reducing hazardous fuel across large landscapes.},

Here, by resequencing 1,506 wild sunflowers from 3 species (Helianthus annuus, Helianthus petiolaris and Helianthus argophyllus), we identify 37 large (1–100 Mbp in size), non-recombining haplotype blocks that are associated with numerous ecologically relevant traits, as well as soil and climate characteristics. Limited recombination in these haplotype blocks keeps adaptive alleles together, and these regions differentiate sunflower ecotypes. For example, haplotype blocks control a 77-day difference in flowering between ecotypes of the silverleaf sunflower H. argophyllus (probably through deletion of a homologue of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)), and are associated with seed size, flowering time and soil fertility in dune-adapted sunflowers. These haplotypes are highly divergent, frequently associated with structural variants and often appear to represent introgressions from other—possibly now-extinct—congeners.

The composition of foliar fungal communities is variable at spatial scales both small (e.g. individual plants) and large (e.g. continents), yet few studies have attempted to tease apart spatial from climatic factors influencing these communities. Moreover, few studies have sampled in more than 1 year to gauge interannual variation in community structure. Location: The Pacific Northwest of western North America. Taxon: Foliar fungi associated with the deciduous tree Populus trichocarpa. Methods: In two consecutive years, we used DNA metabarcoding to characterize foliar fungal communities of Populus trichocarpa across its geographic range, which encompasses a sharp climatic transition as it crosses the Cascade Mountain Range. We used multivariate analyses to (a) test for and differentiate spatial and environmental factors affecting community composition and (b) test for temporal variation in community composition across spatial and environmental gradients. Results: In both study years, we found that foliar fungal community composition varied among sites and between regions (east vs. west of the Cascades). We found that climate explained more variation in community composition than geographic distance, although the majority of variation explained by each was shared. We also found that interannual variation in community composition depended on environmental context: communities located in the dry, eastern portion of the tree's geographic range varied more between study years than those located in the wet, western portion of the tree's range. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the environment plays a greater role in structuring foliar fungal communities than dispersal limitation.},

We aimed to quantify spatial variation in community-level vulnerability indices based on niche limits, not just central tendencies, to predict where climate changes will produce rapid, pronounced shifts in ecological communities. Location: North America. Taxon: Epiphytic lichenized fungi. Methods: We integrated broad-extent herbarium data (46,343 North American sites, for estimation of realized niches) with systematic, whole-community macrolichen surveys from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis inventory (6,474 U.S. sites, for standardized vulnerability estimation). We introduce three niche-based vulnerability indices describing (a) percentage of vulnerable species occurring at their upper climatic limits, (b) community-mean percentile, and (c) deviation of local conditions from community-mean upper limits. We also performed sensitivity analyses and evaluated vulnerability in future climate change scenarios. Results: Sensitivity of indices to uncertainty in climate variables was minor. Present-day vulnerability was greatest in north-central California, in the Southwest along the western Colorado Plateau, and on the Southeastern coastal plain—locations where climatically-induced compositional changes will become most evident. Under future warming scenarios (+0.5 to + 3.6°C increases), the percentage of U.S. epiphytic macrolichen communities exceeding critical values grew from about 2%–20%. Main conclusions: In all scenarios the most vulnerable communities were concentrated in low-elevation and southerly locations, suggesting that many ostensibly “warm-adapted” communities may be close to exceeding their climatic limits. Findings indicate that warming and moisture changes will modify community compositions through the local loss of intolerant species pushed beyond their niche limits. Assessing vulnerability of bioindicators such as lichens will help prioritize locations where the greatest climate-induced changes in species distributions and diversity will occur.},

   abstract = {Climate is the primary driver of the distribution of tree species worldwide, and the potential for adaptive evolution will be an important factor determining the response of forests to anthropogenic climate change. Although association mapping has the potential to improve our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of climatically relevant traits, the utility of adaptive polymorphisms uncovered by such studies would be greatly enhanced by the development of integrated models that account for the phenotypic effects of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their interactions simultaneously. We previously reported the results of association mapping in the widespread conifer Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). In the current study we used the recursive partitioning algorithm 'Random Forest' to identify optimized combinations of SNPs to predict adaptive phenotypes. After adjusting for population structure, we were able to explain 37% and 30% of the phenotypic variation, respectively, in two locally adaptive traits-autumn budset timing and cold hardiness. For each trait, the leading five SNPs captured much of the phenotypic variation. To determine the role of epistasis in shaping these phenotypes, we also used a novel approach to quantify the strength and direction of pairwise interactions between SNPs and found such interactions to be common. Our results demonstrate the power of Random Forest to identify subsets of markers that are most important to climatic adaptation, and suggest that interactions among these loci may be widespread. © 2012 Holliday et al.},

   abstract = {While deep learning has enabled tremendous progress on text and image datasets, its superiority on tabular data is not clear. We contribute extensive benchmarks of standard and novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based models such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of datasets and hyperparameter combinations. We define a standard set of 45 datasets from varied domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking methodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good hyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data ($\sim$10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks (NNs). This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming to build tabular-specific NNs: 1. be robust to uninformative features, 2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20 000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.},

   abstract = {Organic matter is of primary importance to the sustainability of long-term site productivity in forest ecosystems. In boreal forests, organic matter accumulates at the surface as mor humus. This may represent a substantial portion of the total nutrient capital of a site, and its decomposition is essential for the short-term availability of nutrients for tree growth and long-term site fertility. However, organic matter accumulation at the soil surface can also effect the forest ecosystem by immobilizing nutrients making them unavailable for plant uptake, and by creating physical and environmental conditions that can impede seedling establishment and survival. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the processes of humus formation and decomposition in order to manage these soils in a manner that will maintain or improve site productivity. This paper provides an overview of (i) the composition of humus, (ii) the conditions in the boreal forest that result in the surface accumulation of humus, (iii) decomposition processes and (iv) the effects of humus on nutrient (especially nitrogen) availability. Questions relating to the detrimental role of surface organic matter accumulation, the effects of natural disturbances (e.g., ®re) and harvesting disturbances on humus loss and accumulation and management practices that can maintain long-term site productivity will also be discussed. #},

   abstract = {Although soil microorganisms play a central role in the soil processes that determine nutrient availability and productivity of forest ecosystems, we are only beginning to understand how microbial communities are shaped by environmental factors and how the structure and function of soil microbial communities in turn influence rates of key soil processes. Here we compare the structure and function of soil microbial communities in seven mature, undisturbed forest types across a range of regional climates in British Columbia and Alberta, and examine the variation in community composition within forest types. We collected the forest floor fermentation (F) and humus (H) layers and upper 10 cm of mineral soil at 3 sites in each of seven forest types (corresponding to seven Biogeoclimatic zones) in both spring and summer. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis was used to investigate the structure of soil microbial communities and total soil microbial biomass; potential activities of extra-cellular enzymes indicated the functional potential of the soil microbial community in each layer at each site.Multivariate analysis indicated that both structure and enzyme activities of soil microbial communities differed among the forest types, and significantly separated along the regional climate gradient, despite high local variation. Soil moisture and organic matter contents were most closely related to microbial community characteristics. Forests in the Ponderosa Pine and Mountain Hemlock zones were distinct from other forests and from each other when comparing potential enzyme activities and had the most extreme moisture and temperature values. Forest floors from the hot and dry Ponderosa Pine forests were associated with enzymes characteristic of water-stress and high concentrations of phenols and other recalcitrant compounds. The wet and cold Mountain Hemlock forests were associated with low enzyme activity.An influence of tree species was apparent at the three sites within the Coastal Western Hemlock zone; high bacterial:fungal biomass ratios were found under western redcedar (Thuja plicata) which also had high pH and base-cation levels, and under Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), which had high N availability. Potential activities enzymes differed among soil layers: potential activities of phenol oxidase and peroxidase were highest in mineral soil, whereas phosphatase, betaglucosidase, NAGase, sulfatase, xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase were highest in the forest floors. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Under these conditions leaf growth is curtailed more than C fixation, and the surplus photosynthates are exported from the leaf. In plants limited by nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), photosynthates are converted into sugars and secondary metabolites. Some surplus C is translocated to roots and released as root exudates or transferred to root-associated microorganisms. Surplus C is also produced under low moisture availability, low temperature, and high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with similar below-ground effects. Many interactions among above- and below-ground ecosystem components can be parsimoniously explained by the production, distribution, and release of surplus C under conditions that limit plant growth.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

At hydrothermal vents, spontaneous synthesis of methane via serpentinization links an energy metabolic reaction with a geochemical homologue. If the first cells were autotrophs, how did the first heterotrophs arise, and what was their substrate? We propose that cell mass roughly similar to the composition of Escherichia coli was the substrate for the first chemoorganoheterotrophs. Amino acid fermentations, pathways typical of anaerobic clostridia and common among anaerobic archaea, in addition to clostridial type purine fermentations, might have been the first forms of heterotrophic carbon and energy metabolism. Ribose was probably the first abundant sugar, and the archaeal type III RubisCO pathway of nucleoside monophosphate conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate might be a relic of ancient heterotrophy. Participation of chemiosmotic coupling and flavin-based electron bifurcation - a soluble energy coupling process - in clostridial amino acid and purine fermentations is consistent with an autotrophic origin of both metabolism and heterotrophy, as is the involvement of S0 as an electron acceptor in the facilitated fermentations of anaerobic heterotrophic archaea.},

Since no category of energy source has disappeared, this has, over time, resulted in an expanding realm of the sources of energy available to living organisms and a concomitant increase in the diversity and complexity of ecosystems. These energy expansions have also mediated the transformation of key aspects of the planetary environment, which have in turn mediated the future course of evolutionary change.

Radiotracer experiments examined the release and bioavailability of C, N, P Fe, and Se following viral lysis of the "brown tide" chrysophyte Aureococcus anophag-efSeerens. Photochemical effects on the dissolved-particulate partitioning and biological uptake of virally released elements were also investigated. Viral lysis of A. anophagefSerens released 50% more C and Se than uninfected control cells to the dissolved phase, while N, P, and Fe remained in the particulate phase. There was a significant inverse correlation between A. unophugefirens and bacterial densities, as well as an increase in particulate organic nitrogen levels in cultures during viral lysis. These observations indicate thitt released dissolved organic matter supported bacterial growth and may be a pathway by which various elements are diverted in microbial food webs. Dissolved nutrients released by viral lysis were accumulated to varying degrees by natural assemblages of marine bacteria and cultured diatoms, and virally regenerated N and P relieved diatom nutrient limitation. During a 4-wk incubation, 80% of C and P within cell lysis debris was released to the diss,olved phase, likely due to bacterial activity. Photochemical degradation of cell lysis debris enhanced dissolved levels of Se (100%) and Fe (50%) and reduced total dissolved C by 15%. Photochemistry doubled the bioavailability of virally released Se to diatoms, while decreasing the bioavailability of C to bacteria threefold. The viral lysis of an A. unophugefirens bloom in the field could release 40 PM dissolved organic carbon and rapidly transfer other released elements to bacteria. Such occurrences may significantly affect water column chemistry, species composition, and succession within marine plankton communities.},

Their model implies that plant production generally should be limited by N on young soils and by P on old soils; N and P supply should more or less equilibrate on intermediate-aged soils. We tested the application of this model to nutrient limitation, using a well characterized substrate age sequence in Hawaiian montane rain forest. Earlier experiments had evaluated nutrient limitation in forests on a young (300 y) and an old (4,100,000 y) substrate on the same developmental sequence; N alone limited tree growth on the young substrate, while P alone did so on the old one. An additional fertilizer experiment based on replicated treatments with N, P, and all other nutrients combined, applied in individually and in all factorial combinations, was established in an intermediate-aged site in the Laupahoehoe Forest Reserve, Hawaii. Here, diameter increments of the dominant tree Metrosideros polymorpha increased slightly with N additions, and nearly doubled when N and P were added together. Additions of elements other than N and P had no significant effect on growth. These results show that N and P had equilibrated (relative to plant requirements) in the intermediate aged site. Together with the earlier experiments, these results suggest that the Walker and Syers model provides a useful starting point for explaining the nature and distribution of nutrient limitation in forest ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Carbon sequestration through tropical reforestation and natural regeneration could make an important contribution to climate change mitigation, given that forest cover in many tropical regions increased during the early part of the 21st century. The size of this carbon sink will depend on the degree to which second-growth forests are permanent and protected from re-clearing. Yet few studies have assessed permanence of reforestation, especially not at a large spatial scale. Here, we analyzed a 14-year time series (2001–2014) of remotely sensed land-cover data, covering all tropical Latin America and the Caribbean, to quantify the extent of second-growth forest permanence. Our results show that in many cases, reforestation in Latin America and the Caribbean during the early 21st century reversed by 2014, limiting carbon sequestration. In fact, reversals of reforestation, in which some or all gains in forest cover in the early 2000s were subsequently lost, were ten times more common than sustained increases in forest cover. Had reversals of reforestation been avoided, forests could have sequestered 0.58 Pg C, over four times more carbon than we estimate was sequestered after accounting for impermanence (0.14 Pg), representing a loss of 75% of carbon sequestration potential. Differences in the prevalence of reforestation reversals across countries suggest an important role for socio-economic, political, and ecological context, with political transitions and instability increasing the likelihood of reversals. These findings suggest that national commitments to reforestation may fall short of their carbon sequestration goals without provisions to ensure long-term permanence of new forests.},

   abstract = {In tropical landscapes, vegetation patches with contrasting tree densities are distributed as mosaics. However, the locations of patches and densities of trees within them cannot be predicted by climate models alone. It has been proposed that plant-fire feedbacks drive functional thresholds at a landscape scale, thereby maintaining open (savanna) and closed (forest) communities as two distinct stable states. However, there is little rigorous field evidence for this threshold model. Here we aim to provide support for such a model from a field perspective and to analyze the functional and phylogenetic consequences of fire in a Brazilian savanna landscape (Cerrado). We hypothesize that, in tropical landscapes, savanna and forest are two stable states maintained by plant-fire feedbacks. If so, their functional and diversity attributes should change abruptly along a community closure gradient. We set 98 plots along a gradient from open savanna to closed forest in the Brazilian Cerrado and tested for a threshold pattern in nine functional traits, five soil features, and seven diversity indicators. We then tested whether the threshold pattern was associated with different fire regimes. Most community attributes presented a threshold pattern on the savanna-forest transition with coinciding breakpoints. The thresholds separated two community states: (1) open environments with low-diversity communities growing in poor soils and dominated by plants that are highly resistant to high-intensity fires; and (2) closed environments with highly diverse plant communities growing in more fertile soils and dominated by shade-tolerant species that efficiently prevent light from reaching the understory. In addition, each state was associated with contrasting fire regimes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that forests and savannas are two coexisting stable states with contrasting patterns of function and diversity that are regulated by fire- plant feedbacks; our results also shed light on the mechanism driving each state. Overall, our results support the idea that fire plays an important role in regulating the distribution of savanna and forest biomes in tropical landscapes. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Forest–savanna mosaics exist across all major tropical regions. Yet, the influence of environmental factors on the distribution of these mosaics is not well explored, limiting our understanding of the environmental constraints on savannas especially in Southeast Asia, where most savannas exist in mosaics. Despite clear structural and functional characteristics indicative of savannas, most SE Asian savannas continue to be classified as forest. This designation is problematic because SE Asian savannas are threatened by both fragmentation and forest-centric management practices. By studying forest–savanna mosaics across SE Asia, we aimed to parse out how landscape mosaics of forest and savanna may be constrained by fire, climate and soil characteristics. We used remotely sensed data to characterize the distribution of tree cover and forest–savanna mosaics. Using regression models, we quantified the relative effects of precipitation, fire frequency, seasonality and soil characteristics on average tree cover and landscape patchiness. We found that low tree cover, indicative of savannas, occurs in drier, seasonal subregions that experience frequent fire. Further, our results demonstrate that fire and precipitation strongly shape landscape patchiness. Landscapes were patchiest in subregions with low precipitation and intermediate fire frequency. These results demonstrate that the environmental factors important in delineating the distribution of savannas globally shape the distribution of tree cover and landscape patchiness across SE Asia. Fire especially drives patterns of tree cover across scales. In a region where fire suppression is a common management strategy, our results suggest that further research studying vegetation response to fire and fire suppression is needed to improve management and conservation of these mosaic landscapes. More broadly, this work demonstrates a useful approach for studying the environmental drivers that influence the distribution of forest–savanna mosaics.},

Climate influences tree cover globally but, at intermediate rainfall (1000 to 2500 millimeters) with mild seasonality (less than 7 months), tree cover is bimodal, and only fire differentiates between savanna and forest. These may be alternative states over large areas, including parts of Amazonia and the Congo.

However, dynamical systems theory suggests that in case of strong spatial interactions between patches of forest and savanna, a boundary between both states is only possible at conditions in which forest and savanna are equally stable, called the ‘Maxwell point.’ Frequency distributions of MODIS tree-cover data at 250 m resolution were used to estimate such Maxwell points with respect to the amount and seasonality of rainfall in both South America and Africa. We tested on a 0.5° scale whether there is a larger probability of local coexistence of forests and savannas near the estimated Maxwell points. Maxwell points for South America and Africa were estimated at 1760 and 1580 mm mean annual precipitation and at Markham’s Seasonality Index values of 50 and 24 %. Although the probability of local coexistence was indeed highest around these Maxwell points, local coexistence was not limited to the Maxwell points. We conclude that critical transitions between forest and savanna may occur when climatic changes exceed a critical value. However, we also conclude that spatial interactions between patches of forest and savanna may reduce the hysteresis that can be observed in isolated patches, causing more predictable forest-savanna boundaries than continental-scale analyses of tree cover indicate. This effect could be less pronounced in Africa than in South America, where the forest-savanna boundary is substantially affected by rainfall seasonality.},

   abstract = {Fire shapes the distribution of savanna and forest through complex interactions involving climate, resources and species traits. Based on data from central Brazil, we propose that these interactions are governed by two critical thresholds. The fire-resistance threshold is reached when individual trees have accumulated sufficient bark to avoid stem death, whereas the fire-suppression threshold is reached when an ecosystem has sufficient canopy cover to suppress fire by excluding grasses. Surpassing either threshold is dependent upon long fire-free intervals, which are rare in mesic savanna. On high-resource sites, the thresholds are reached quickly, increasing the probability that savanna switches to forest, whereas low-resource sites are likely to remain as savanna even if fire is infrequent. Species traits influence both thresholds; saplings of savanna trees accumulate bark thickness more quickly than forest trees, and are more likely to become fire resistant during fire-free intervals. Forest trees accumulate leaf area more rapidly than savanna trees, thereby accelerating the transition to forest. Thus, multiple factors interact with fire to determine the distribution of savanna and forest by influencing the time needed to reach these thresholds. Future work should decipher multiple environmental controls over the rates of tree growth and canopy closure in savanna. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {A major decline in the abundance of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) has recently occurred in the United States, primarily as a result of white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Raben.). However, no information on the status of whitebark pine in British Columbia, Canada, was available. We sampled 54 subalpine stands in British Columbia, examining all whitebark pine trees within plots for evidence of blister rust and mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk.) damage. About 21% of all whitebark pine stems were dead, and blister rust was the most important agent of mortality. Of all living trees sampled, 27% had obvious blister rust infection (can-kers), but actual incidence was suspected of being as high as 44% (using all evidence of blister rust). Blister rust incidence and whitebark pine mortality were significantly related to differences in stand structure and the presence of Ribes spp., but relationships with local climate and site variables were absent or weak. The lack of strong relationships with climate suggests favourable conditions for the spread of the disease throughout most of British Columbia. Very little evidence of mountain pine beetle was found. Overall, the prospects for whitebark pine in British Columbia do not appear good; a large reduction in population levels seems imminent. Résumé : Une diminution importante dans l'abondance du pin à blanche écorce (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) est sur-venue récemment aux États-Unis, surtout à cause de la rouille vésiculeuse du pin blanc (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Raben.). Cependant, aucune information n'est disponible sur l'état de santé du pin à blanche écorce en Co-lombie Britannique, au Canada. Nous avons échantillonné 54 peuplements subalpins en Colombie Britannique en exa-minant tous les pins à blanche écorce présents dans les parcelles pour détecter la présence de dommages causés par la rouille vésiculeuse et le dendroctone du pin ponderosa (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk.). Environ 21% des tiges de pin à blanche écorce étaient mortes et la rouille vésiculeuse était la principale cause de mortalité. De tous les arbres vi-vants échantillonnés, 27% étaient à coup sûr infectés par la rouille vésiculeuse (présence d'un chancre) mais il y a tout lieu de croire que l'incidence réelle est aussi élevée que 44% si on tient compte de l'ensemble des symptômes de la rouille vésiculeuse. L'incidence de la rouille vésiculeuse et la mortalité du pin à blanche écorce étaient significative-ment corrélées aux différences dans la structure du peuplement et à la présence de Ribes spp. mais il y avait peu ou pas de relations avec le climat local ou les variables du site. L'absence de relations étroites avec le climat suggère que les conditions pour la propagation de la maladie sont favorables un peu partout en Colombie Britannique. Il y avait très peu d'indices de la présence du dendroctone du pin ponderosa. Dans l'ensemble, l'avenir du pin à blanche écorce en Colombie Britannique semble peu prometteur; une forte réduction des niveaux de population semble imminente.

To gain insight into how these ecosystems respond, we quantified vegetation change over 2 decades (21-29 y) in xeric and submesic P. albicaulis ecosystems near the northern edge of the species' range on the leeward side of the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. We compared changes in overstory and understory vegetation composition of these stands to changes in mesic, non-whitebark pine ecosystems in the same region. Multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) analysis showed that the overstory of xeric whitebark pine ecosystems became compositionally similar to mesic ecosystems, i.e., there was increased dominance by Abies lasiocarpa or Tsuga mertensiana. Yet understory composition in xeric whitebark pine stands changed little and there was continued regeneration of P. albicaulis. Submesic whitebark pine stands developed a dense canopy dominated by T. mertensiana, and although their understories did not become compositionally similar to mesic ecosystems, there was minimal P. albicaulis regeneration. Understory stability in xeric and submesic whitebark pine ecosystems over 21-29 y suggests compositional resilience in these ecosystems to multiple stresses and disturbances. However, ongoing disturbance affecting both overstory and understory P. albicaulis might still result in the loss of this keystone species.},

   abstract = {The translocation of species into habitable locations outside of their current ranges, termed assisted migration, has been proposed as a means of saving vulnerable species from extinction as a result of climate change. We explore the use of this controversial technique using a threatened keystone species in western North America, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), as a case study. Species distribution models predict that whitebark pine will be extirpated from most of its current range as temperatures rise over the next 70 years. However, the same models indicate that a large area within northwestern British Columbia, Canada, is climatically suitable for the species under current conditions and will remain so throughout the 21st century. To test the capacity of whitebark pine to establish relative to climatic and habitat features within its predicted climatic range, we planted seeds from seven populations in eight locations spanning from 600 km southeast to 800 km northwest of the northern boundary of the current species range. During the first three growing seasons, germination occurred in all locations. Nearly three times as many treated (induced maturation and broken dormancy) than untreated seeds germinated, and most treated seeds germinated a year earlier than the untreated seeds. Germination, survival, and growth were primarily influenced by seed mass, site climate conditions related to the duration of snow cover, and provenance temperature. Our experiment provides a preliminary test of models predicting the existence of climatically suitable whitebark pine habitat north of the current species ranges. More broadly, our techniques and results inform the development of scientific guidelines for assisting the migration of other species that are highly threatened by climate change. Applied case studies of this kind are critical for assessing the utility of species distribution models as conservation planning tools. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

In British Columbia, this tree is a component of harvested forests, yet knowledge of post-harvest survivorship and factors that promote successful retention is lacking. Our objectives are to describe the temporal attrition of retained mature whitebark pine trees and to identify factors that likely influence survivorship during the critical initial post-harvest period. We assessed five sepa-rate harvest units in southeastern British Columbia. Dendrochronological investigation revealed that retained trees experienced high annual mortality rates (3–16%) across harvest sites during the initial five-year post-harvest period. By eight years post-harvest, retention survivorship ranged from 17–80%. After eight years post-harvest, mortality rates drastically declined. The preponder-ance of fallen stems oriented towards the northeast suggests that storm system events arriving from the Pacific Ocean are the most significant drivers of blowdown. We estimate that survivorship is positively associated with shorter tree heights and longer crown lengths, a lack of disease cankers, a greater presence of rodent wounding, and higher numbers of surrounding retained trees. We found little effect based on slope and aspect. As these trees are an endangered species, harvest operations should be practiced cautiously in associated forests. We recommend carefully selecting retention trees, ensuring an adequate number of neighbor trees, and orienting retention patches to avoid predominant storm wind directions.},

Information about genetic diversity and population structure is of fundamental importance for its conservation and restoration. However, current knowledge on the genetic constitution and genomic variation is still limited for WBP. In this study, an integrated genomics approach was applied to characterize seed collections from WBP breeding programs in western North America. RNA-seq analysis was used for de novo assembly of the WBP needle transcriptome, which contains 97,447 protein-coding transcripts. Within the transcriptome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered, and more than 22,000 of them were non-synonymous SNPs (ns-SNPs). Following the annotation of genes with ns-SNPs, 216 ns-SNPs within candidate genes with putative functions in disease resistance and plant defense were selected to design SNP arrays for high-throughput genotyping. Among these SNP loci, 71 were highly polymorphic, with sufficient variation to identify a unique genotype for each of the 371 individuals originating from British Columbia (Canada), Oregon and Washington (USA). A clear genetic differentiation was evident among seed families. Analyses of genetic spatial patterns revealed varying degrees of diversity and the existence of several genetic subgroups in the WBP breeding populations. Genetic components were associated with geographic variables and phenotypic rating of WPBR disease severity across landscapes, which may facilitate further identification of WBP genotypes and gene alleles contributing to local adaptation and quantitative resistance to WPBR. The WBP genomic resources developed here provide an invaluable tool for further studies and for exploitation and utilization of the genetic diversity preserved within this endangered conifer and other five-needle pines.},

A thorough assessment would consider genetic variation in each species across the species range, but for most tree species, such information is simply not available. For this reason, we used spatial variation associated with Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification zones (BEC zones) representing different macroclimates as a proxy for adaptive genetic variation. We re-assessed the 2005 conservation status calculated in this manner using updated datasets collected in 2017, considered both in situ and ex situ conservation, and used an adjusted criterion for small-stature tree species. Results of our gap analysis revealed that overall, the native tree species in 89% of the conservation units (defined as species-by-biogeoclimatic-zone combinations) were well protected in situ. Of the 43 native tree species in the province, 12 species had conservation gaps in one or more biogeoclimatic zones. When in situ and ex situ conservation were considered jointly, the overall percentage of conservation units that were adequately protected improved to 91%. Needs for additional ex situ collections or in situ protection are discussed in terms of both BEC zones and individual species. In most cases, we recommend seed collection as the most feasible short-term option to cover gaps in protected area coverage.},

   abstract = {Eight white pine species are widely distributed among the forests of western Canada and the United States. The different forest communities with these species contribute biodiversity to the western landscape. The trees themselves provide various ecosystem services, including wildlife habitat and watershed protection. White pine communities range in elevation from lower to upper treeline, in successional stage from seral to climax, and in stand type from krummholz to closed-canopy forest. Many white pine species are moderately to strongly fire-dependent for regeneration; several species are extreme stress tolerators and persistent on harsh sites. Among the white pines are the oldest-living trees, the world's largest pines, species dependent on birds for seed dispersal, species important for grizzly bear habitat and species of high commercial timber value. The principal threats to white pine populations are blister rust (Cronartium ribicola, pathogen), fire suppression, succession, mountain pine beetle and climate change. Severe population declines in several white pine species are attributed to losses caused by these factors acting either alone or together, and sometimes in concert with logging and other land-use changes. The importance and particular interactions of these threats vary by region and species. For example, many northern and western populations of whitebark pine are seriously declining from a combination of mountain pine beetle outbreaks and severe blister rust infestations. As whitebark pines provide many keystone services on high-elevation sites, their loss would impact forest composition and structure, succession, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Although there are serious challenges to science-based management and conservation (especially in remote American wilderness areas), prompt and effective intervention promoting regeneration of blister rust-resistant white pines could mitigate these severe impacts. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

The ecological process model FIRESUM (a FX~ succession Model) has been adapted to whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) forests of the inland Northwest and Rocky Mountains, U.S.A. FI~SUM simulates tree establishment, growth, and mortality on a 400-m 2 plot. Also modelled are live and dead fuel accumulations, fire behavior, fuel reduction, and insect and disease mortality. The following influences on tree establishment and growth are simulated in the model: temperature, water stress, site quality, and light conditions. An additional submodel in HRESUM simulates the mutualistic relationship between the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the whitebark pine. Seed caches made by the Clark's nutcracker are evidently responsible for most whitebark pine regeneration. Whitebark pine seeds are also an important food for red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), black bear (Ursus americana), and especially grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis). Infestations of white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) and mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and successional replacement by shade-tolerant conifers can reduce whitebark pine populations, which can adversely impact dependent wildlife species. The model FIRESUM was used to investigate the effects of fire, insects, and disease on whitebark pine regeneration and growth. Model predictions of basal area by tree species are presented for contrasting disturbance scenarios. Simulation predictions indicate severe reduction in some whitebark pine populations if current trends are not altered.

   abstract = {The center of diversity for white pine blister rust (WPBR) (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fischer) most likely stretches from central Siberia east of the Ural Mountains to Asia, possibly bounded by the Himalayas to the south. The alternate hosts for WPBR, Asian five-needled pines (Pinus L.) and Ribes L. native to that region have developed WPBR resistance. Because the dispersal of C. ribicola to Europe and North America occurred within the last several hundred years, the North American five-needled white pines, Pinus subsections, Strobus and Parya, had no previous selection pressure to develop resistance. Establishment of WPBR in North American resulted when plants were transported both ways across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1705, Lord Weymouth had white pine (P. strobis L.), also called weymouth pine in Europe, seed and seedlings brought to England. These trees were planted throughout eastern Europe. In the mid-1800s, WPBR outbreaks were reported in Ribes and then in white pines in eastern Europe. The pathogen may have been brought to Europe on an infected pine from Russia. In the late 1800s American nurserymen, unaware of the European rust incidence, imported many infected white pine seedlings from France and Germany for reforestation efforts. By 1914, rust-infected white pine nursery stock was imported into Connecticut, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin, and in the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and British Colum-bia. The range of WPBR is established in eastern North America and the Pacific Northwest. New infection sites in Nevada, South Dakota, New Mexico and Colorado have been observed during the 1990s. W hite pine blister rust causes cankers on five-needled white pines and can kill weakened, infected trees after several years. The currants and gooseberries (Ribes L.) are alternate hosts for this disease. Orange rust uredia develop on the under surface of currant or gooseberry leaves during the summer. Severe infection in these shrubs causes defoliation not death. During the past century, forestry practices in the United States have attempted to eradicate Ribes but this has proved unsuccessful in controlling the rust. The concept of eradication and state regulations have prevented the development of a Ribes industry in the United States during the past century. A brief historical summary of the origin and dispersal of the rust within the United States are presented here as a basis for further discussion concerning Ribes, pines, and white pine blister rust.},

Logistic regression models were calibrated from reconstructed pre-epidemic stand conditions and post-epidemic mortality levels resulting from a widespread mountain pine beetle outbreak that occurred from 1909 to 1940. Basal area (m 2 /ha) and stand density index (SDI) were stand-level variables that completely differentiated stands into attacked or non-attacked categories. Whitebark pine stands with basal areas above 10 m 2 /ha (44 ft 2 /acre) or with an SDI above 80 had a 100% probability of being attacked. Tree diameter, basal area per 0.04 ha, trees per 0.04 ha, and number of stems in a tree cluster were significant predictors of individual tree attack ðp 0:001Þ in logistic regression. The tree-level model may be used to estimate anticipated cumulative mortality in currently or potentially infested whitebark pine stands. Stand susceptibility to mountain pine beetle infestation may be identified from density (basal area) or relative density (SDI) thresholds. Predictor variables selected by the models corroborate the susceptible host characteristics identified in other mountain pine beetle-pine systems.

Episodic outbreaks are a common occurrence in the beetles' primary host, lodgepole pine. Current outbreaks, however, are occurring in habitats where outbreaks either did not previously occur or were limited in scale. Herein, we address widespread, ongoing outbreaks in high-elevation, whitebark pine forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where, due to an inhospitable climate, past outbreaks were infrequent and short lived. We address the basic question: are these outbreaks truly unprecedented and a threat to ecosystem continuity? In order to evaluate this question we (1) present evidence that the current outbreak is outside the historic range of variability; (2) examine system resiliency to MPB disturbance based on adaptation to disturbance and host defenses to MPB attack; and (3) investigate the potential domain of attraction to large-scale MPB disturbance based on thermal developmental thresholds, spatial structure of forest types, and the confounding influence of an introduced pathogen. We conclude that the loss of dominant whitebark pine forests, and the ecological services they provide, is likely under continuing climate warming and that new research and strategies are needed to respond to the crisis facing whitebark pine. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Current high rates of mortality of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) are due to white pine blister rust caused by the exotic fungus, Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch, and the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins). These two mortality agents interact in whitebark pine; mountain pine beetle preferentially selects white pine blister rust-infected whitebark pine over healthy trees, and likelihood of attack has been observed to increase with infection severity. We examined attack and emergence rates, and size and sex ratio of mountain pine beetle in whitebark pines exhibiting varying white pine blister rust infection severities. Mountain pine beetle attack density was lowest on the most severely infected trees, but emergence rates and size of beetles from these trees were greater than those from uninfected and less severely infected trees. Low attack rates on severely infected whitebark pine may indicate these trees have lower defenses and that fewer beetle attacks are needed to kill them. Higher beetle emergence rates from severely infected trees may be due to low intraspecific competition resulting from low attack rates or differences in nutrient quality.},

   abstract = {Warming temperatures and changing weather patterns are causing more frequent and severe disturbances in western North American forests. The increasing length and severity of recent wildfire seasons have annually caused widespread injury to millions of trees, facilitating the subsequent outbreak of various subcortical insect species that infest damaged hosts. The subcortical woodboring beetle assemblage (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) comprises insects that feed primarily within the phloem and sapwood of defensively compromised trees, often causing severe degradation of high value stands slated for post-fire salvage logging. We studied three 2017 fire complexes within mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests in southern British Columbia to investigate the post-fire infestation patterns of woodborers. We observed the highest levels of woodborer infestation in forests with moderate to high levels of fire injury, rather than in extremely burnt stands with greater tree mortality. We also found that woodborer infestation likelihood could be predicted from a combination of tree height and fire injury for individual trees. In addition, infestation was more likely in large (>13.1 m tall) rather than small trees (<13 m tall) with the same levels of fire injury. We conclude that the woodboring beetle assemblage present in dry interior Douglas-fir forests is more aggressive and ubiquitous than previously observed, and these insects actively attack and kill living trees that may otherwise survive after fires with both economic and ecological ramifications. Economically, post-fire salvage may be more effective in preventing woodborer population build-up and timber degradation by targeting moderately scorched stands immediately after wildfire. Ecologically, woodborer impacts to trees that would otherwise survive may compromise their biological legacy and impair the diversity and composition of future Douglas-fir stands.},

   abstract = {Facilitative interactions among plant species enable plant community development under stressful environmental conditions. Previous studies in two treeline communities within the alpine-treeline ecotone on the Rocky Mountain Front in northwestern Montana, USA, indicated that whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) serves as the majority tree island initiator, thus facilitating the development of tree islands (Resler and Tomback, 2008). However, 33.7% of whitebark pine at these treeline study sites were infected by the introduced pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which causes white pine blister rust. We examined the prevalence of whitebark pine, its ecological role, and the incidence of blister rust within two study sites, Tibbs Butte and Wyoming Creek, to the south on the Beartooth Plateau, and within two study sites, Stanley Glacier and Gibbon Pass, to the north in Kootenay and Banff National Parks, for comparison with information from the Rocky Mountain Front (Resler and Tomback, 2008). We found that whitebark pine was an important component of treeline communities in both the southern and northern study areas, although its abundance and ecological role varied with study site. Nearly half the solitary trees sampled overall in the northern and southern study areas were whitebark pine. Whitebark pine was also the most frequently occurring conifer species among tree islands at three of the four study sites. Across all study sites, whitebark pine served as tree island initiator for 29.4% of the tree islands sampled, but was a more frequent initiator within two study sites. Blister rust incidence for the Wyoming Creek study site in the southern study area was 7.7%, and for the Stanley Glacier study site in the northern study area, 16.2%. Damage and mortality over time from Cronartium ribicola will diminish the current ecological role of whitebark pine as a facilitator of landscape vegetation pattern development and may confound predictions of upward movement of treeline in response to climate warming.},

Vegetation classification is the basis of the BEC framework and underlies the many resource management applications of the BEC system. The BEC approach was initially adopted from the pioneering work of Vladamir Krajina by the British Columbia Forest Service in 1976 as a five-year program to assist with forest regeneration decision-making but over the subsequent 40 years, it has developed into a comprehensive framework for understanding ecosystems in a climatically and topographically complex region.

Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification is a system of ecological classification widely used in British Columbia. The system has been expanded by the B.C. Forest Service from the pioneering work of V.J. Krajina and his students. The recognized units result from a synthesis of vegetation, climate, and soil data. The approach to classification is hierarchical with three interrelated levels of integration. The multiple-category, local and regional levels involve vegetation and site; a chronological level deals with vegetation dynamics. Taxa of any level and category can be integrated according to their interpretive value for management. Vegetation units are defined and arranged into a floristic hierarchy based on the plant association , using traditional Braun-Blanquet methods modified to suit regional conditions. Where possible , zonal (climatic climax) plant associations are identified, thus defining biogeoclimatic sub-zones, which are divided into variants and aggregated into zones, regions, and formations. Plant associations are transformed into site associations-environmentally characterized classes of ecosystems with similar biotic potential. Site associations are then subdivided into series and types, using biogeoclimatic and edaphic characteristics as differentiae. Examples of classification at local and regional levels are provided, as are examples of management applications. Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification is a unique approach that draws on several of the Eu-ropean (including Russian) and North American schools of vegetation and land classification, and has similarities with the Cajander forest type, Barnes land type, Daubenmire habitat type, and Hills site type approaches. The classification provides a powerful integrative and predictive tool, with proven practical value for forest managers.},

   abstract = {Projecting future distributions of ecosystems or species climate niches has widely been used to assess the potential impacts of climate change. However, variability in such projections for the future periods, particularly the variability arising from uncertain future climates, remains a critical challenge for incorporating these projections into climate change adaptation strategies. We combined the use of a robust statistical modeling technique with a simple consensus approach consolidating projected outcomes for multiple climate change scenarios, and exemplify how the results could guide reforestation planning. Random Forest (RF) was used to model relationships between climate (1961-1990), described by 44 variables, and the geographic distribution of 16 major ecosystem types in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The model predicted current ecosystem distributions with high accuracy (mismatch rate = 4-16% for most ecosystem classes). It was then used to predict the distribution of ecosystem climate niches for the last decade (2001-2009) and project future distributions for 20 climate change scenarios. We found that geographic distributions of the suitable climate habitats for BC ecosystems have already shifted in 23% of BC since the 1970s. Consensus projections for future periods (2020s, 2050s, 2080s) indicated climates suitable for grasslands, dry forests, and moist continental cedar-hemlock forests would substantially expand; climate habitat for coastal rainforests would remain relatively stable; and habitat for boreal, subalpine and alpine ecosystems would decrease substantially. Using these consensus projections and data on the occurrence of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in BC ecosystems, we estimated a twofold increase in seedling demand for this frost-sensitive, commercially important timber species, suggesting managers could begin planning to expand seed inventories and seed orchard capacity to more widely plant this species on logged sites. The results of this work demonstrate the power of RF for building climate envelope models and illustrate the utility of consensus projections for incorporating uncertainty about future climate into management planning. It also emphasizes the immediate need for adapting natural resource management to a changing climate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Most forests today are multi-specific and heterogeneous forests ('mixed forests'). However, forest modelling has been focusing on mono-specific stands for a long time, only recently have models been developed for mixed forests. Previous reviews of mixed forest modelling were restricted to certain categories of models only and were generally not considering application and suitability. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the models designed for or applied to modelling mixed forest growth and dynamics and to review the suitability of the different model types according to their intended purposes. The first part of the paper gives an overview of previous classifications, after which a new and overall classification scheme is presented. Next, the characteristics of the six modelling approaches that were distinguished are described: distance-dependent stand models, distribution models, average tree models, distance-dependent tree models, distance-independent tree models and gap models. All, except gap models, are close to mono-specific stands modelling approaches. The second part of the paper describes the main applications of these modelling approaches and presents a critical analysis of their suitability. Applications can be separated between growth and yield studies and forest dynamics simulation studies. Attention must be paid to recruitment sub-models, which appear to be inadequate in many models, but which highly influence the simulation outcome. All types of model were used as management tools. Stand level simulations fit the yield data better than tree level simulations, as a result of cumulated model errors from tree to stand level. However, tree level approaches seem most appropriate to understand stand growth as affected by competition between individuals of different species. Forest dynamics were mostly modelled using distribution models, gap models and distance-dependent tree models. The latter appeared to be less suitable because of the difficulties in modelling 3D stand structure over large periods and areas. Gap models could be applied to larger areas and time periods than distribution models, especially when they included detailed descriptions of the ecological functioning of the ecosystem. In sum the empirical models appeared more accurate in their predictions than mechanistic models, but they are highly dependent on the data used for parameterisation. That makes them unsuitable for extrapolation to other systems or conditions. Although mechanistic models can also be misused, adding mechanistic approaches to empirical observations is necessary to model the growth and dynamics of complex forest systems.: S 0 3 0 4-3 8 0 0 (0 1) 0 0 4 7 6-8 A.

   abstract = {The Mediterranean region of Chile is considered a biodiversity hot spot. An increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation, as projected for the end of this century by global circulation models, would likely change the distribution of the sclerophyllous thorny shrubland and woodland. In order to assess those potential impacts, the MAXENT algorithm was used to project potential changes in the distribution of the Mediterranean ecosystem. Ecological niche models were fitted and used to project the potential distribution of these forest ecosystems by the end of the century. Projections were made using data from the PRECIS model for the A2 and B2 climate change scenarios and two strategies of occupancy: free migration and non-migration. Distribution models of sclerophyllous, woodland and shrubland performed accurately representing current species' distribution. When we assume non-migration responses under climate change scenarios, results reveal a decrease in the distribution area for all the species. The areas where the highest reduction in a suitable environment was found are located along the coastline, where higher temperature increases have been projected. For native ecosystems from the Andean Range region, such as communities dominated by thorny species, a stable habitat was found, associated with a higher adaptation capability to future climatic projections. Hence, in the future, buffer zones originated by "topo-climatic" conditions might play a key role in protecting Central Chile biodiversity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Four orthogonal canonical discriminant functions were used to describe the realized climate space for British Columbia's ecosystems and to model portions of the realized niche space for tree species under current and predicted future climates. This conceptually simple model is capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range limits for many species. We analyzed how the realized climate space of current ecosystems changes in extent, elevation, and spatial distribution under climate change scenarios and evaluated the implications for potential tree species habitat. Tree species with their northern range limit in British Columbia gain potential habitat at a pace of at least 100 km per decade, common hardwoods appear to be generally unaffected by climate change, and some of the most important conifer species in British Columbia are expected to lose a large portion of their suitable habitat. The extent of spatial redistribution of realized climate space for ecosystems is considerable, with currently important sub-boreal and montane climate regions rapidly disappearing. Local predictions of changes to tree species frequencies were generated as a basis for systematic surveys of biological response to climate change.},

   abstract = {Animal-plant interactions are threatened by ongoing climate change, deforestation, and defaunation. The disruption of biotic interactions leads to loss of ecosystem services but estimates of the magnitude of reductions are rarely available. Using a seed disperser primate community in the Amazon as study case, we forecast the magnitude of seed dispersal services to be lost as function of the future redistribution of species. In the most likely scenario, our projections indicate average contractions of 56% (23 to 100% reduction) on the suitable areas for the studied primates. As result, we found billions of seeds of a model tree (Manilkara bidentata) might fail to be dispersed by this primate community on each fruiting season. Primate contribution to seed dispersal was, however, uneven among species, highlighting the endangered large-bodied woolly monkey Lagothrix cana as a keystone disperser. That species alone was responsible for about 64% of all Manilkara seeds dispersed in the present and up to 71% in the future. Niche mismatch will, however, lead to 37% of the future plant distribution not being able to host its second top disperser (the tufted capuchin Sapajus apella), exacerbating losses on potential seed dispersal. Our projections indicate that seed dispersal in tropical forests might be hampered by global changes, even if defaunation by poaching is controlled. The forecasted magnitude of loss in seed dispersal services is alarming and may have been overlooked in conservation assessments. In a similar manner, niche mismatch and disruption of biotic interactions will likely impair ecosystems functions and resilience worldwide.},

These 60 tests cover eight biogeoclimatic zones and 25 subzones within the biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification (BEC) in British Columbia. Ten provenances are common among 60 provenances tested at each site. Mean height (20-year) was measured at 57 of the 60 sites, incidence of western gall rust assessed at 56 sites, terminal weevil at 49 sites, and needle cast at 50 sites. There is large site-to-site variation in all traits. Geographic models using latitude, longitude and elevation of test site location as predictors explained 47%, 35%, 33%, 27% and 8% of site variation for height, survival, incidence of needle cast, terminal weevil and western gall rust, respectively. BEC zones accounted for about the same amount of the site variation as geographic models, suggesting both accounted for the effect of site environments relating mainly to temperature and precipitation. Within BEC zones, site variation in height seems to be related to subzones associated with moisture gradient, but not temperature. Sites in the moist, mild ICH subzone and the dry, cool MS subzone along the southern Rocky Mt. Trench represent the best forest land for intensive silviculture of lodgepole pine, being highly productive with low pest hazard except needle cast. These sites are followed in productivity by sites across the vast interior stretching from the Skeena/Bulkley river basin in the northwest (moist SBS subzone), to the interior wetbelt on Shuswap-Quesnel Highland (moist, cool ICH subzone), and the Thompson Plateau in the southern interior, where lodgepole pine grew well with relatively low pest hazard at most sites. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2005.},

   abstract = {Key message: Adaptation of forest management to climate change requires an understanding of the effects of climate on forests, industries and communities; prediction of how these effects might change over time; and incorporation of this knowledge into management decisions. This requires multiple forms of knowledge and new approaches to forest management decisions. Partnerships that integrate researchers from multiple disciplines with forest managers and local actors can build a shared understanding of future challenges and facilitate improved decision making in the face of climate change.Context: Climate change presents significant potential risks to forests and challenges for forest managers. Adaptation to climate change involves monitoring and anticipating change and undertaking actions to avoid the negative consequences and to take advantage of potential benefits of those changes.Aims: This paper aimed to review recent research on climate change impacts and management options for adaptation to climate change and to identify key themes for researchers and for forest managers.Methods: The study is based on a review of literature on climate change impacts on forests and adaptation options for forest management identified in the Web of Science database, focusing on papers and reports published between 1945 and 2013.Results: One thousand one hundred seventy-two papers were identified in the search, with the vast majority of papers published from 1986 to 2013. Seventy-six percent of papers involved assessment of climate change impacts or the sensitivity or vulnerability of forests to climate change and 11 % (130) considered adaptation. Important themes from the analysis included (i) predicting species and ecosystem responses to future climate, (ii) adaptation actions in forest management, (iii) new approaches and tools for decision making under uncertainty and stronger partnerships between researchers and practitioners and (iv) policy arrangements for adaptation in forest management.Conclusions: Research to support adaptation to climate change is still heavily focused on assessing impacts and vulnerability. However, more refined impact assessments are not necessarily leading to better management decisions. Multi-disciplinary research approaches are emerging that integrate traditional forest ecosystem sciences with social, economic and behavioural sciences to improve decision making. Implementing adaptation options is best achieved by building a shared understanding of future challenges among different institutions, agencies, forest owners and stakeholders. Research-policy-practice partnerships that recognise local management needs and indigenous knowledge and integrate these with climate and ecosystem science can facilitate improved decision making.},

Ideally, forest managers can source this information from climate analogs within their jurisdictions, but the emergence of unfamiliar climates is a distinct possibility with particular challenges. Here, we present an assessment of the emergence of mid-21st-century climates with no analog in the 20th-century climates of British Columbia (BC), and the extent to which these novel climates are described by climate analogs elsewhere in North America. We use a recently developed linear method of novel climate detection in parallel with Random Forest classification to evaluate the robustness of novel climate inferences. Our results suggest that a majority of the province's area will remain free of novel climates over this time period, and therefore that BC's ecological knowledge system, the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification, can remain the dominant source of climate analogs for mid-21st-century forest management planning horizons. Nevertheless, we detected a robust pattern of climates that are novel to BC in mid-21st-century climate projections at low elevations in the coastal, southern interior, and northeastern regions of the province. There appears to be potential to inform forest management in some of these novel climates with analogs from adjacent states and provinces. We demonstrate that extrapolations into novel climates typically understate the magnitude of climate change and modeling uncertainty, creating a false impression of robust predictions in locations where model performance is poorest. By identifying portions of their landscapes that are prone to emergence of novel climates, forest managers can avoid management errors and prioritize the search for analogs beyond the boundaries of their knowledge systems.},

   abstract = {Biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification (BEC) has underpinned terrestrial ecosystem management and conservation planning in British Columbia, Canada since the early 1970s, serving the province well for over 40 years as expectations for the use and management of the public land base have evolved. The system is now critically challenged because (1) BEC champions in government, academia, and the private sector are disappearing through retirement and layoffs; (2) BEC is based on outdated notions of climax ecosystems in equilibrium with climate; and (3) the contemporary relevance and intellectual richness of this approach to ecosystem science is not comprehended by a generation of scientists and resource managers grappling with accelerating rates of change in climate and other environmental drivers. This review addresses ways to ensure that BEC remains robust and useful in an uncertain future. The Author proposes that BEC embrace complex systems science. Through a dialectical analysis of alternative paradigms in ecology, it is argued that BEC's holistic, developmental view of terrestrial ecosystems is fundamentally compatible with complexity theory and provides the information content missing from contemporary ecosystem ecology. Two examples of nonlinear modelling (adaptive landscapes and agent-based) to illustrate how the classification system can adapt from a largely linear and equilibrium, to a nonlinear, nonequilibrium perspective of ecosystem dynamics. The BEC program itself must function as a complex adaptive system to survive government downsizing and guide ecosystem management during difficult times, and to challenge and enlighten a new generation of scientists and citizens. © 2011 Published by NRC Research Press.},

   abstract = {As a nature-based and cost-effective solution, forestation plays a crucial role in combating global warming, biodiversity collapse, environmental degradation, and global well-being. Although China is acknowledged as a global leader of forestation and has achieved considerable overall success in environmental improvements through mega-forestation programs, many negative effects have also emerged at local scales due to the planting of maladapted tree species. To better help achieve carbon neutrality and the new vision of an ecological civilization, China has committed to further increase forestation. However, where forestation lands and such efforts should really be located is not so well understood yet and agreed upon, especially in the face of rapid climate change. Based on an ensemble-learning machine, we predicted the spatial habitats (ecological niche) of the forest, grassland, shrubland, and desert under present and future climate conditions based on the natural climax vegetation distribution across China. We show that the potential forestation lands are mainly located in eastern China, which is east of the Hu Line (also known as the Heihe-Tengchong Line). Under future climate change, forests will shift substantially in the latitudinal, longitudinal, and elevational distribution. Potential forestation lands will increase by 33.1 million hectares through the 2070s, mainly due to the conversions of shrub and grassland to forests along the Hu Line. Our prediction map also indicates that grassland rehabilitation is the universal optimal vegetation restoration strategy in areas west of the Hu Line. This analysis is consistent with much of the observed evidence of forestation failures and recent climate-change-induced forest range shifts. Our results provide an overview and further show the importance of adaptive science-based forestation planning and forest management.},

This study builds on previous digital soil mapping (DSM) research in BC and develops provincial-scale maps. Soil taxonomic classes (e.g., great groups and order) and parent material classes were mapped at a 100 m spatial resolution for BC (944 735 km 2 ). Training points were generated from detailed and semi-detailed soil survey maps. The training points were intersected with 26 topographic indices for mapping parent materials with an additional 9 climatic and vegetation indices for mapping soil classes. The soil–environmental relationships were inferred using the random forest (RF) classifier. The fitted models were used to predict 23 soil great groups, 9 soil orders, and 10 parent material classes. Accuracy assessments were performed using n = 14 570 validation points for parent material classes and n = 14 316 validation points for soil classes, acquired from the BC Soil Information System. The accuracy rates for soil great groups, orders, and parent material classes were 55%, 62%, and 69%, respectively, and kappa coefficients were 0.37, 0.41, and 0.59, respectively. This study demonstrated that when RF was trained using CSMs, the accuracy for the resulting DSM was higher than the original CSM. To assess prediction uncertainties, ignorance uncertainty maps were developed using class-probability layers generated by the RF models. },

   abstract = {As anthropogenic climate change continues the risks to biodiversity will increase over time, with future projections indicating that a potentially catastrophic loss of global biodiversity is on the horizon1–3. However, our understanding of when and how abruptly this climate-driven disruption of biodiversity will occur is limited because biodiversity forecasts typically focus on individual snapshots of the future. Here we use annual projections (from 1850 to 2100) of temperature and precipitation across the ranges of more than 30,000 marine and terrestrial species to estimate the timing of their exposure to potentially dangerous climate conditions. We project that future disruption of ecological assemblages as a result of climate change will be abrupt, because within any given ecological assemblage the exposure of most species to climate conditions beyond their realized niche limits occurs almost simultaneously. Under a high-emissions scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5), such abrupt exposure events begin before 2030 in tropical oceans and spread to tropical forests and higher latitudes by 2050. If global warming is kept below 2 °C, less than 2% of assemblages globally are projected to undergo abrupt exposure events of more than 20% of their constituent species; however, the risk accelerates with the magnitude of warming, threatening 15% of assemblages at 4 °C, with similar levels of risk in protected and unprotected areas. These results highlight the impending risk of sudden and severe biodiversity losses from climate change and provide a framework for predicting both when and where these events may occur.},

There is a rich literature projecting spatial shifts in climatic suitability for tree species and strong scientific evidence for the necessity of assisted migration. However, there has been limited translation of this research into operational reforestation, due in part to mismatches to the information needs of practitioners. Here, we describe a practitioner-focused climate change informed tree species selection (CCISS) model to support reforestation decisions in British Columbia (BC). CCISS projects the climate change redistribution of bioclimate units from the multi-scaled Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) system with machine-learning for 90 modelled futures. It leverages the reforestation knowledge from BEC to make site-specific species projections of reforestation feasibility with climate change uncertainty metrics. We present 21st-century feasibility projections for a comprehensive set of tree species native to western North America. Some general trends are evident: augmentation of the number of feasible species in sub-boreal regions due to the rapid expansion of feasibility for temperate species; attrition at low elevations in southern BC due to declines in the feasibility of native species with little compensation by non-native species; and turnover at mid-elevations as declining feasibility for subalpine species is compensated by uphill expansion of climatic feasibility for submontane species. Edaphic (soil) factors are important; feasibility declines are higher on relatively dry sites than on wetter sites for most species. Our analysis emphasizes that changes in feasibility are species-specific, spatially variable, and influenced by edaphic site factors. By employing the multi-scaled BEC system that currently informs operational reforestation, CCISS facilitates translation of research into actionable guidance for practitioners.},

   abstract = {Climate change is one of the most influential drivers of biodiversity. Speciesspecific differences in the reaction to climate change can become particularly important when interacting species are considered. Current studies have evidenced temporal mismatching of interacting species at single points in space, and recently two investigations showed that species interactions are relevant for their future ranges. However, so far we are not aware that the ranges of interacting species may become substantially spatially mismatched. We developed separate ecological-niche models for a monophagous butterfly (Boloria titania) and its larval host plant (Polygonum bistortd) based on monthly interpolated climate data, land-cover classes, and soil data at a 10′-grid resolution. We show that all of three chosen global-change scenarios, which cover a broad range of potential developments in demography, socio-economics, and technology during the 21st century from moderate to intermediate to maximum change, will result in a pronounced spatial mismatch between future niche spaces of these species. The butterfly may expand considerably its future range (by 124-258%) if the host plant has unlimited dispersal, but it could lose 52-75% of its current range if the host plant is not able to fill its projected ecological niche space, and 79-88% if the butterfly also is assumed to be highly dispersal limited. These findings strongly suggest that climate change has the potential to disrupt trophic interactions because co-occurring species do not necessarily react in a similar manner to global change, having important consequences at ecological and evolutionary time scales. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

   abstract = {Aim: Climate change and deforestation will redistribute biodiversity in the next century. Species-specific differences in the response to these stressors will lead to distribution decoupling of interacting species. However, consequences for ecosystem services are poorly known. Here, we assess the potential effects of future distribution mismatch on a key ecosystem service mediated by seed dispersal and pollination interactions: the sustainable exploitation of Brazil nuts. Location: The Amazon. Major taxa studied: Woody plants, medium-sized mammals, and insects. Time period: Present day, end of the 21st century. Methods: Combining ecological niche models to simulations of tree cover loss and dispersal constraints, we compare the forecasted distribution of the plant to that of its interacting fauna of pollinators and seed dispersers. Results: Our projections indicate that climate change itself could have no or even slightly positive effects on the distribution of the Brazil nut tree, expected to increase by up to 6% by the year 2090. However, the pollinators of this tree were forecasted lose nearly 50% of their suitable distribution in the future, leading to an almost 80% reduction in co-occurrence potential. In addition, local pollinator richness was predicted to diminish by 20%, with likely consequences for pollination redundancy and resilience to subsequent environment changes. Although range contractions were also forecasted for some seed dispersers in the future, the overall patterns of potential co-occurrence between the Brazil nut tree and seed dispersers, as well as local richness of seed dispersers. were mostly unabated. Main conclusions: The forecasted declines in pollinator diversity may reduce ecosystem functional redundancy and threaten the long-term resilience of the services provided by Brazil nut trees. Such pervasive and indirect effects of climate change, often neglected and unaccounted for in most conservation assessments, may have cascading effects upon into economies and human well-being worldwide.},

Any modification in seasonal activity in one species can have consequences on interacting species, within and among trophic levels. In this overview, we focus on synchronisation mismatches that can occur between tightly interacting species such as hosts and parasitoids or preys and predators. Asynchronies happen because species from different trophic levels can have different response rates to climate change. We show that insect species alter their seasonal activities by modifying their life-cycle through change in voltinism or by altering their development rate. We expect strong bottom–up effects for phenology adjustments rather than top–down effects within food-webs. Extremely complex outcomes arise from such trophic mismatches, which make consequences at the community or ecosystem levels tricky to predict in a climate change context. We explore a set of potential consequences on population dynamics, conservation of species interactions, with a particular focus on the provision of ecosystem services by predators and parasitoids, such as biological pest control.},

Location Europe. Methods We developed ecological niche models (generalized linear models) for 36 European butterfly species and their larval host plants based on climate and land-use data. We projected future distributional changes using three integrated global change scenarios for 2080. Observed and projected mismatches in potential butterfly niche space and the niche space of their hosts were first used to assess changing range limitations due to interacting species and then to investigate the importance of different ecological characteristics. Results Most butterfly species were primarily limited by climate. Species dwelling in warm areas of Europe and tolerant to large variations in moisture conditions were projected to suffer less from global change. However, a gradient from climate to host plant control was apparent, reflecting the range size of the hosts. Future projections indicated increased mismatching of already host-plant-limited butterflies and their hosts. Butterflies that utilize plants with restricted ranges were projected to suffer most from global change. The directions of these relationships were consistent across the scenarios but the level of spatial mismatching of butterflies and their host plants increased with the severity of the scenario. Main conclusions Future changes in the co-occurrence of interacting species will depend on political and socio-economic development, suggesting that the composition of novel communities due to global change will depend on the way we create our future. A better knowledge of ecological species characteristics can be utilized to project the future fate and potential risk of extinction of interacting species leading to a better understanding of the consequences of changing biotic interactions.

Large scale afforestation and reforestation projects have occurred or planned in Asia-Pacific region; however, the direct impact of climate change has not been widely considered.

The cause-and-effect approaches in ecology have been, over time, both praised and criticized. At the IX International Botanical Congress in Montrtal, Krajina was criticized for following traditional cause-and-effect philosophy (see Hustich 1960). It was during this period, the early 1960s, that the International Biological Programme (IBP) came into being. Perhaps the planners of IBP concentrated their efforts more on quantifying the magnitudes and rates of ecosystem processes and less on delving into the very elusive question "why." However, in the mid-1960s things turned around. Why? became fashionable again. One of the fathers of systems ecology defined that subdiscipline as "an interlocking complex of processes characterized by many cause-effect pathways" (Watt 1966). Many excellent reviews on the history of ecology and its His interest in botany, in particular, plant taxonomy, began when he entered high school in 1917. He joined Charles University in Prague in 1923 and came under the tutelage of Professor Karel Domin. His doctoral thesis in 1927 was on the taxonomy of Festuca species, mainly from the Tatra Mountains. His taxonomic interests continued throughout his life.},

   abstract = {Climate is a core aspect of a species’ niche that is frequently incorporated into species distribution models (SDMs). The proliferation of readily accessible climate data is stimulating the increasing use of climate-based species distribution models (CSDMs) in conservation planning and management. However, it is uncertain how sensitive CSDMs are to the choice of climate data used. We compared the performance of maximum entropy-based CSDMs calibrated with seven different climate data sets (WorldClim, Chelsa, TerraClimate, Climate Research Unit Time-Series [CRU-TS], PRISM, StreamCat, and EarthEnv). For each species (four amphibians and two reptiles in California), we used a standardized, objective procedure to select climate predictors from each data set. We then assessed performance with standard metrics, calculated variable importance scores, and compared predicted distributions to historical range maps of the target species. The climate data set used affected CSDM performance, with models based on some data sets overpredicting and others underpredicting distributions compared with historical range maps of each of the species. Critically, for the six species we tested, no one climate data set always performed worst or best. These results indicate that the effects of different climate data sets should be incorporated into model evaluation when developing, applying, and interpreting climate-based SDMs.},

The objective of this study is to analyse for the first time the performance of different climatic predictors in modelling the potential distribution of B. utilis in the subalpine and alpine belts of the Himalayan region. Using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) we aim at examining climatic factors controlling the species distribution under current climate conditions. We evaluate the predictive ability of climate data derived from different statistical methods GLMs were created using least correlated bioclimatic variables derived from two different climate data sets: 1) interpolated climate data (i.e. WORLDCLIM; Hijmans et al., 2005), and 2) quasi-mechanistical statistical downscaling (i.e. CHELSA; Karger et al., 2016). Model accuracy was evaluated using threshold-independent (Area Under the Curve) and threshold-dependent (True Skill Statistics) measures. Although there were no significant differences between the models in AUC, we found highly significant differences (p ≤ 0.01) in TSS. We conclude that models based on variables of CHELSA climate data had higher predictive power, whereas models using WORLDCLIM climate data consistently overpredicted the potential suitable habitat for B. utilis. Although climatic variables of WORLDCLIM are widely used in modelling species distribution, our results suggest to treat them with caution when topographically complex regions like the Himalaya are in focus. Unmindful usage of climatic variables for environmental niche models potentially causes misleading projections.},

The JWA dataset was derived from a high-density weather station network with adjacent stations about 17-21 km apart and served as our high quality climate data. The original NCAR dataset (about 0.9°×0.9°) was resampled at 1 km×1 km resolution using the bilinear interpolation method and served as our "poor" quality data source. We found that, on average, the NCAR dataset underestimated the 1998 NPP by 15% over the whole study area compared with the JWA dataset, by 21% in needle forest, by 18% in grass/cereal-cropland, by 14% in broadleaf forest, by 11% in broadleaf crops, and by 2% in shrubs. However, the NCAR dataset slightly overestimated NPP by 1% in savannas in comparison with the JWA dataset. We also found that using the NCAR temperature data (daily maximum and minimum temperatures), specific humidity, and precipitation underestimated regional NPP by 17, 7, and 2%, respectively, compared with the JWA dataset. However, using the NCAR global solar radiation did not significantly change the estimate of NPP although the NCAR solar radiation was much greater than the JWA solar radiation. By using a new sensitivity analysis technique called the Extension of Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST), we found that the required accuracy for the 1998 growing season was ±2.9°C for daily maximum temperature, ±2.0°C for daily minimum temperature, ±2.5 MJ/m2 per day for daily global solar radiation, and ±3.4 g/kg for daily specific humidity to estimate NPP with an overall confidence coefficient of 95% in the Hokkaido Island. The analytical approach developed in this study can also be applied to other input variables/parameters and other ecosystem models. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wiens2009,
   abstract = {As the rate and magnitude of climate change accelerate, understanding the consequences becomes increasingly important. Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological niche constraints are used to project future species distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and two distributional algorithms, together with information on distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070. Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large losses of species in some ''hotspots'' of vulnerability. Differences in distributional shifts among species will change species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to incorporate future conditions into conservation and management practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act despite the uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the future, is not an option. birds California ecological niche species distribution models conservation T he world is changing rapidly, because of the cascading and intertwined effects of human population growth, widespread poverty, economic globalization, land-use change, and, looming over it all, climate change. These changes are having profound effects on biological diversity, effects that will only become more dramatic and dire as the pace of environmental change quickens. The challenges to conservation and environmental management are immense. Traditionally, conservation has focused on protecting individual species and their habitats. This focus derives from more than a century of work describing the relationships between organisms and features of the environment. Virtually all of this work has been shaped by thinking about ecological niches. Niche concepts and theory, in the form of ''ecological niche models'' or ''bioclimatic envelope models'' (1, 2), have become central in efforts to understand how future climate change may have an impact on species and their habitats. In this paper, after providing a brief perspective on ''ecological niches,'' we describe how niche thinking and modeling have been used to project changes in the distributions of species and consider several assumptions and uncertainties. We illustrate the approach with examples from our work on California birds and conclude by assessing the usefulness of niche-based models for projecting climate-change impacts on biodiversity and the implications for conservation and management.},

   abstract = {Aim: Species distribution modelling typically relies completely or partially on climatic variables as predictors, overlooking the fact that these are themselves predictions with associated uncertainties. This is particularly critical when such predictors are interpolated between sparse station data, such as in the tropics. The goal of this study is to provide a new set of satellite-based climatic predictor data and to evaluate its potential to improve modelled species-climate associations and transferability to novel geographical regions. Location: Rain forests areas of Central Africa, the Western Ghats of India and South America. Methods: We compared models calibrated on the widely used WorldClim station-interpolated climatic data with models where either temperature or precipitation data from WorldClim were replaced by data from CRU, MODIS, TRMM and CHIRPS. Each predictor set was used to model 451 plant species distributions. To test for chance associations, we devised a null model with which to compare the accuracy metric obtained for every species. Results: Fewer than half of the studied rain forest species distributions matched the climatic pattern better than did random distributions. The inclusion of MODIS temperature and CHIRPS precipitation estimates derived from remote sensing each allowed for a better than random fit for respectively 40% and 22% more species than models calibrated on WorldClim. Furthermore, their inclusion was positively related to a better transferability of models to novel regions. Main conclusions: We provide a newly assembled dataset of ecologically meaningful variables derived from MODIS and CHIRPS for download, and provide a basis for choosing among the plethora of available climate datasets. We emphasize the need to consider the method used in the production of climate data when working on a region with sparse meteorological station data. In this context, remote sensing data should be the preferred choice, particularly when model transferability to novel climates or inferences on causality are invoked.},

   abstract = {Rhipicephalus microplus is one of the most widely distributed and economically important ticks, transmitting Babesia bigemina, B. bovis and A. naplasma marginale. It was recently introduced to West Africa on live animals originating from Brazil. Knowing the precise environmental suitability for the tick would allow veterinary health officials to draft vector control strategies for different regions of the country. To test the performance of modelling algorithms and different sets of environmental explanatory variables, species distribution models for this tick species in Benin were developed using generalized linear models, linear discriminant analysis and random forests. The training data for these models were a dataset containing reported absence or presence in 104 farms, randomly selected across Benin. These farms were sampled at the end of the rainy season, which corresponds with an annual peak in tick abundance. Two environmental datasets for the country of Benin were compared: one based on interpolated climate data (WorldClim) and one based on remotely sensed images (MODIS). The pixel size for both environmental datasets was 1. km. Highly suitable areas occurred mainly along the warmer and humid coast extending northwards to central Benin. The northern hot and drier areas were found to be unsuitable. The models developed and tested on data from the entire country were generally found to perform well, having an AUC value greater than 0.92. Although statistically significant, only small differences in accuracy measures were found between the modelling algorithms, or between the environmental datasets. The resulting risk maps differed nonetheless. Models based on interpolated climate suggested gradual variations in habitat suitability, while those based on remotely sensed data indicated a sharper contrast between suitable and unsuitable areas, and a patchy distribution of the suitable areas. Remotely sensed data yielded more spatial detail in the predictions. When computing accuracy measures on a subset of data along the invasion front, the modelling technique Random Forest outperformed the other modelling approaches, and results with MODIS-derived variables were better than those using WorldClim data.},

However, it is unclear how the species’ suitable habitat will respond to future climate changes. We aimed to select the most accurate one among seven data mining models to predict the current and future suitable habitats for M. azedarach in China. These models include: maximum entropy (MaxEnt), support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), naive bayesian model (NBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). A total of 906 M. azedarach locations were identified, and sixteen climate predictors were used for model building. The models’ validity was assessed using three measures (Area Under the Curves (AUC), kappa, and overall accuracy (OA)). We found that the RF provided the most outstanding performance in prediction power and generalization capacity. The top climate factors affecting the species’ suitable habitats were mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), followed by the number of frost-free days (NFFD), degree-days above 18 °C (DD > 18), temperature difference between MWMT and MCMT, or continentality (TD), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and degree-days below 18 °C (DD < 18). We projected that future suitable habitat of this species would increase under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for the 2011–2040 (2020s), 2041–2070 (2050s), and 2071–2100 (2080s).

   abstract = {There is now ample evidence of the ecological impacts of recent climate change, from polar terrestrial to tropical marine environments. The responses of both ¯ora and fauna span an array of ecosystems and organizational hierarchies, from the species to the community levels. Despite continued uncertainty as to community and ecosystem trajectories under global change, our review exposes a coherent pattern of ecological change across systems. Although we are only at an early stage in the projected trends of global warming, ecological responses to recent climate change are already clearly visible. T he Earth's climate has warmed by approximately 0.6 8C over the past 100 years with two main periods of warming, between 1910 and 1945 and from 1976 onwards. The rate of warming during the latter period has been approximately double that of the ®rst and, thus, greater than at any other time during the last 1,000 years 1. Organisms , populations and ecological communities do not, however, respond to approximated global averages. Rather, regional changes, which are highly spatially heterogeneous (Fig. 1), are more relevant in the context of ecological response to climatic change. In many regions there is an asymmetry in the warming that undoubtedly will contribute to heterogeneity in ecological dynamics across systems. Diurnal temperature ranges have decreased because minimum temperatures are increasing at about twice the rate of maximum temperatures. As a consequence, the freeze-free periods in most mid-and high-latitude regions are lengthening and satellite data reveal a 10% decrease in snow cover and ice extent since the late 1960s. Changes in the precipitation regime have also been neither spatially nor temporally uniform (Fig. 1). In the mid-and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere a decadal increase of 0.5±1% mostly occurs in autumn and winter whereas, in the sub-tropics, precipitation generally decreases by about 0.3% per decade 1. There is now ample evidence that these recent climatic changes have affected a broad range of organisms with diverse geographical distributions 2±6. We assess these observations using a process-oriented approach and present an integrated synopsis across the major taxonomic groups, covering most of the biomes on Earth. We focus on the consequences of thirty years of warming at the end of the twentieth century, and review the responses in (1) the phenology and physiology of organisms, (2) the range and distribution of species, (3) the composition of and interactions within communities , and (4) the structure and dynamics of ecosystems, highlighting common and contrasting features amongst the taxa and systems considered. Phenology PhenologyÐthe timing of seasonal activities of animals and plantsÐis perhaps the simplest process in which to track changes in the ecology of species in response to climate change. Birds, butter¯ies and wild plants, in particular, include popular and easily identi®able species and thus have received considerable attention from the public. As a result many long-term phenological data sets have been collected. Studies in Europe and North America have revealed phenological trends that very probably re¯ect responses to recent climate change 7,8. Common changes in the timing of spring activities include earlier breeding or ®rst singing of birds, earlier arrival of migrant birds, earlier appearance of butter¯ies, earlier choruses and spawning in amphibians and earlier shooting and ¯owering of plants (Fig. 2). In general, spring activities have occurred progressively earlier since the 1960s (Table 1). Some evidence also indicates a later onset of autumnal phenolo-gical events, but these shifts are less pronounced and show a more heterogeneous pattern. Studies reveal different proportions of bird species which advance, delay or do not change autumn migration 9 , and trends of leaf colouring of trees at neighbouring stations often show contradictory signals 10. In Europe, for example, leaf colour changes show a progressive delay of 0.3±1.6 days per decade, whereas the length of the growing season has increased in some areas by up to 3.6 days per decade over the past 50 years 8,11. This extension of the growing season accords with the lengthening of 12 6 4 days derived from satellite data 12 as well as with an advance in the seasonal cycle by 7 days and an increase in amplitude of the annual CO 2 cycle since the 1960s 13. Environmental links In contrast with the climatic factors controlling autumn phenology, the climate signal controlling spring phenology is fairly well understood: nearly all phenophases correlate with spring temperatures in the preceding months. For birds, temperatures on the migration route are also important. Some spring events, such as egg-laying of several song birds and the start of the vegetation period in northern and central Europe, also correlate with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, which quanti®es winter climatic conditions 5,14,15 (Fig. 2). An analysis of 50 years of data on 13 plant species in 137 localities revealed responses to the NAO in 71% of the total, with early-blooming and herbaceous species showing greater responses to winter warming than late-blooming and woody plants 15.

The predictions of the global circulation model CGCM3 (the third-generation coupled global climate model from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis) indicated that the temperature in The Great Xing'an Mountain will rise by 2-4°C over the next 100 years. This paper predicts the potential distributions of wetlands in this area under the current and warming climate conditions. This predication was performed by the Random Forests model, with 18 environmental variables, which will reflect the climate and topography conditions. The model has been proven to have a great prediction ability. The wetland distributions are primarily topography-driven in the Great Xing'an Mountains. Mean annual temperature, warmness index, and potential evapotranspiration ratio are the most important climatic factors in wetland distributions. The model predictions for three future climate scenarios show that the wetland area tends to decrease, and higher emission will also cause more drastic shrinkage of wetland distributions. About 30% of the wetland area will disappear by 2050. The area will decrease 62.47, 76.90, and 85.83%, respectively, under CGCM3-B1, CGCM3-A1B, and CGCM3-A2 by 2100. As for spatial allocation, wetlands may begin to disappear from the sides to the center and south to north under a warming climate. Under CGCM3-B1, the loss of wetlands may mainly occur in the south hills with flatter terrain, and some may occur in the north hills and intermontane plains. Under CGCM3-A1B, severe vanish of wetlands is predicted. Under CGCM3-A2, only a small area of wetlands may remain in the north of the high mountains. © 2011 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

We contribute extensive benchmarks of standard and novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based models such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of datasets and hyperparameter combinations. We define a standard set of 45 datasets from varied domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking methodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good hyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data ($\sim$10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks (NNs). This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming to build tabular-specific NNs: 1. be robust to uninformative features, 2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20 000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.},

Responding to this need in the United States, nine federal agencies have signed a memorandum of understanding on the subject of developing a common framework of ecoregions. However, considerable disagreement over how to define ecoregions and confusion over the strengths and limitations of existing frameworks stand in the way of achieving this goal. This paper presents some perspectives on the nature and definition of ecoregions related to this confusion and provides a brief overview of the weight of evidence approach to mapping ecoregions, using an example initiated by the US Environmental Protection Agency. To effectively implement ecosystem assessment, management, and research at local, regional, and national levels, research is needed to increase our understanding of ecoregions. We must find ways to illustrate the nature of ecoregion boundaries and the variability of characteristics within ecoregions as they relate to management issues. Research must also be conducted on comparing existing frameworks and developing indices of ecological integrity to effectively evaluate their usefulness.},

Ecoregions provide a holistic framework for flexible, comparative analysis of complex environmental problems. Ecoregions mapping has intellectual foundations in both geography and ecology. However, a hallmark of ecoregions mapping is that it is a truly interdisciplinary endeavor that demands the integration of knowledge from a multitude of sciences. Geographers emphasize the role of place, scale, and both natural and social elements when delineating and characterizing regions. Ecologists tend to focus on environmental processes with special attention given to energy flows and nutrient cycling. Integration of disparate knowledge from the many key sciences has been one of the great challenges of ecoregions mapping, and may lie at the heart of the lack of consensus on the "optimal" approach and methods to use in such work. Through a review of the principal existing US ecoregion maps, issues that should be addressed in order to advance the state of the art are identified. Research related to needs, methods, data sources, data delivery, and validation is needed. It is also important that the academic system foster education so that there is an infusion of new expertise in ecoregion mapping and use.},

The workflow allows researchers and practitioners to identify taxonomic and geographic errors in millions of records in an automatic, reproducible, and transparent manner. It also allows users to correct several types of taxonomic and geographic errors. We applied the workflow to clean global tree occurrence records. The results showed that among the 30,242,556 occurrence records of 58,034 species extracted from eight databases, only 8,624,319 (28.5%) records of 22,766 (39.2%) species were classified as high quality after running through the workflow. Inaccurate and non-standard taxon names appeared as a more severe problem than geographical errors that people are most familiar with. The workflow developed in this study can be easily adapted to clean occurrence records of other taxonomic groups, which allows researchers and practitioners to reduce uncertainties in their findings.},

   abstract = {4th ed. Authors' names in reverse order on previous edition. Forest soils are the foundation of the entire forest ecosystem and complex, long-term interactions between trees, soil animals, and the microbial community shape soils in ways that are very distinct from agricultural soils. The composition, structure, and processes in forest soils at any given time reflect current conditions, as well as the legacies of decades (and even millennia) of interactions that shape each forest soil. Reciprocal interactions are fundamental; vegetation alters soil physical properties, which influence soil biology and chemistry, which in turn influence the growth and success of plants. These dynamic systems may be strongly influenced by intentional and unintentional management, ranging from fire to fertilization. Sustaining the long-term fertility of forest soils depends on insights about a diverse array of soil features and changes over space and time. Since the third edition of this successful book many new interests in forest soils and their management have arisen, including the role of forest soils in sequestering carbon, and how management influences rates of carbon accumulation. This edition also expands the consideration of how soils are sampled and characterized, and how tree species differ in their influence on soil development. Clearly structured throughout, the book opens with the origins of forest soil science and ends with the application of soil science principles to land management. This new edition provides : A completely revised and updated Fourth Edition of this classic textbook in the field A coherent overview of the major issues surrounding the ecology and management of forest soils Global in scope with coverage of soil types ranging from the tropical rainforest soils of Latin America to the boreal forest soils of Siberia New chapters on Management: Carbon sequestration; Evidence-based approaches and applications of geostatistics, GIS and taxonomies A clear overview of each topic, informative examples/case studies, and an overall context for helping readers think clearly about forest soils An introduction to the literature of forest soil science and to the philosophy of forest soil science research This coherent overview of the major issues surrounding the ecology and management of forest soils will be particularly useful to students taking courses in soil science, forestry, agronomy, ecology, natural resource management, environmental management and conservation, as well as professionals in forestry dealing with the productivity of forests and functioning of watersheds. 1.

Temperature and precipitation anomalies between 1 CO2 and 2 CO2 runs were combined with baseline observed weather data for both countries for the 1980-1989 period. Forecast seasonal fire weather severity was similar for the four GCMs, indicating large increases in the areal extent of extreme fire danger in both countries under a 2 CO2 climate scenario. A monthly analysis, using the Canadian GCM, showed an earlier start to the fire season, and significant increases in the area experiencing high to extreme fire danger in both Canada and Russia, particularly during June and July. Climate change as forecast has serious implications for forest fire management in both countries. More severe fire weather, coupled with continued economic constraints and downsizing, mean more fire activity in the future is a virtual certainty. The likely response will be a restructuring of protection priorities to support more intensive protection of smaller, high-value areas, and a return to natural fire regimes over larger areas of both Canada and Russia, with resultant significant impacts on the carbon budget.},

   abstract = {It is widely accepted that photosynthetic bacteria played a crucial role in Fe(II) oxidation and the precipitation of iron formations (IF) during the Late Archean-Early Paleoproterozoic (2.7-2.4 Ga). It is less clear whether microbes similarly caused the deposition of the oldest IF at ca. 3.8 Ga, which would imply photosynthesis having already evolved by that time. Abiological alternatives, such as the direct oxidation of dissolved Fe(II) by ultraviolet radiation may have occurred, but its importance has been discounted in environments where the injection of high concentrations of dissolved iron directly into the photic zone led to chemical precipitation reactions that overwhelmed photooxidation rates. However, an outstanding possibility remains with respect to photochemical reactions occurring in the atmosphere that might generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a recognized strong oxidant for ferrous iron. Here, we modeled the amount of H2O2 that could be produced in an Eoarchean atmosphere using updated solar fluxes and plausible CO2, O2, and CH4 mixing ratios. Irrespective of the atmospheric simulations, the upper limit of H2O2 rainout was calculated to be <106 molecules cm-2 s-1. Using conservative Fe(III) sedimentation rates predicted for submarine hydrothermal settings in the Eoarchean, we demonstrate that the flux of H2O2 was insufficient by several orders of magnitude to account for IF deposition (requiring ~1011 H2O2 molecules cm-2 s-1). This finding further constrains the plausible Fe(II) oxidation mechanisms in Eoarchean seawater, leaving, in our opinion, anoxygenic phototrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing micro-organisms the most likely mechanism responsible for Earth's oldest IF.},

These sources are: geochemical energy, sunlight, oxygen, flesh and fire. The first two were present at the start, but oxygen, flesh and fire are all consequences of evolutionary events. Since no category of energy source has disappeared, this has, over time, resulted in an expanding realm of the sources of energy available to living organisms and a concomitant increase in the diversity and complexity of ecosystems. These energy expansions have also mediated the transformation of key aspects of the planetary environment, which have in turn mediated the future course of evolutionary change. Using energy as a lens thus illuminates patterns in the entwined histories of life and Earth, and may also provide a framework for considering the potential trajectories of life-planet systems elsewhere.},

The main objective of this paper is to review documented evidence of the impacts of climate change trends on forest productivity since the middle of the 20th century. We first present a concise overview of the climate controls of forest production, provide evidence of how the main controls have changed in the last 55 years, followed by a core section outlining our findings of observed and documented impacts on forest productivity and a brief discussion of the complications of interpreting trends in net primary production (NPP). At finer spatial scales, a trend is difficult to decipher, but globally, based on both satellite and ground-based data, climatic changes seemed to have a generally positive impact on forest productivity when water was not limiting. Of the 49 papers reporting forest production levels we reviewed, 37 showed a positive growth trend, five a negative trend, three reported both a positive and a negative trend for different time periods, one reported a positive and no trend for different geographic areas, and two reported no trend. Forests occupy ≈ 52% of the Earth's land surface and tend to occupy more temperature and radiation-limited environments. Less than 7% of forests are in strongly water-limited systems. The combined and interacting effects of temperature, radiation, and precipitation changes with the positive effect of CO2, the negative effects of O3 and other pollutants, and the presently positive effects of N will not be elucidated with experimental manipulation of one or a few factors at a time. Assessments of the greening of the biosphere depend on both accurate measurements of rates (net ecosystem exchange, NPP), how much is stored at the ecosystem level (net ecosystem production) and quantification of disturbances rates on final net biome production. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The severe dry-season droughts in 2005 and 2010, driven by Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, have been widely investigated in terms of drought severity and impacts on ecosystems. Although the influence of Pacific SST anomaly on wet-season precipitation has been well recognized, it remains uncertain to what extent the droughts driven by Pacific SST anomaly could affect forest greenness and photosynthesis in the Amazon. Here, we examined the monthly and annual dynamics of forest greenness and photosynthetic capacity when Amazon ecosystems experienced an extreme drought in 2015/2016 driven by a strong El Niño event. We found that the drought during August 2015–July 2016 was one of the two most severe meteorological droughts since 1901. Due to the enhanced solar radiation during this drought, overall forest greenness showed a small increase, and 21.6% of forests even greened up (greenness index anomaly ≥1 standard deviation). In contrast, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an indicator of vegetation photosynthetic capacity, showed a significant decrease. Responses of forest greenness and photosynthesis decoupled during this drought, indicating that forest photosynthesis could still be suppressed regardless of the variation in canopy greenness. If future El Niño frequency increases as projected by earth system models, droughts would result in persistent reduction in Amazon forest productivity, substantial changes in tree composition, and considerable carbon emissions from Amazon.},

   abstract = {Essential resources such as water, nutrients and light vary over space and time and plant growth rates are expected to vary accordingly. We examined the effects of climate, soil and logging disturbances on diameter growth rates at the tree and stand level, using 165 1-ha permanent sample plots distributed across Bolivian tropical lowland forests. We predicted that growth rates would be higher in humid than in dry forests, higher in nutrient-rich than nutrient-poor forests and higher in logged than non-logged forests. Across the 165 plots we found positive basal area increases at the stand level, which agree with the generally reported biomass increases in tropical forests. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that climate variables, in particular water availability, were the strongest drivers of tree growth. More rainfall, a shorter and less intense dry period and higher temperatures led to higher tree growth rates. Tree growth increased modestly with soil fertility and basal area growth was greatest at intermediate soil fertility. Surprisingly, tree growth showed little or no relationship with total soil nitrogen or plant available soil phosphorus. Growth rates increased in logged plots just after logging, but this effect disappeared after 6 years. Synthesis. Climate is the strongest driver of spatial variation in tree growth, and climate change may therefore have large consequences for forest productivity and carbon sequestration. The negative impact of decreased rainfall and increased rainfall seasonality on tree growth might be partly offset by the positive impact of increased temperature in these forests. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Earlier spring leaf unfolding is a frequently observed response of plants to climate warming. Many deciduous tree species require chilling for dormancy release, and warming-related reductions in chilling may counteract the advance of leaf unfolding in response to warming. Empirical evidence for this, however, is limited to saplings or twigs in climate-controlled chambers. Using long-term in situ observations of leaf unfolding for seven dominant European tree species at 1,245 sites, here we show that the apparent response of leaf unfolding to climate warming (S T, expressed in days advance of leaf unfolding per °C warming) has significantly decreased from 1980 to 2013 in all monitored tree species. Averaged across all species and sites, S T decreased by 40% from 4.0 ± 1.8 days °C-1 during 1980-1994 to 2.3 ± 1.6 days °C-1 during 1999-2013. The declining S T was also simulated by chilling-based phenology models, albeit with a weaker decline (24-30%) than observed in situ. The reduction in S T is likely to be partly attributable to reduced chilling. Nonetheless, other mechanisms may also have a role, such as 'photoperiod limitation' mechanisms that may become ultimately limiting when leaf unfolding dates occur too early in the season. Our results provide empirical evidence for a declining S T, but also suggest that the predicted strong winter warming in the future may further reduce S T and therefore result in a slowdown in the advance of tree spring phenology.},

   abstract = {The ranges of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate. As temperatures rise, ecosystems with nowhere to go, such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened. However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climates ultimate persistence. Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr-1), derived from spatial gradients (°Ckm-1) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (°C yr-1) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earths surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42 km yr-1 (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08 km yr-1), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26 km yr-1), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100 years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and environmental conditions, the "fit" of organisms to their environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near-optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related to habitat occupancy, e.g., environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i.e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck's concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which a species' distributional responses to environmental conditions will lead to a "mismatch" between its environmental tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1) the colonization of "environmental islands" (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the persistence of "trailing-edge" populations in species tracking changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space, in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous and changing environments.},

Forest gaps are commonly created as small disturbances in secondary forests to improve forest regeneration, nutrient cycling, ecosystem functioning, and biodiversity. The objective of this study was to investigate the responses of the physico-chemical and biological properties and microbial communities in soil to different sizes of forest gaps—including small gaps (60–80 m2), medium gaps (130–160 m2), and large gaps (270–300 m2)—and to examine the driving factors that influence soil microbial community structure and composition. The results show that Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and actinomycetes were mainly aggregated in the gaps, and the structural diversity of soil microbial communities was related to the gap size (p < 0.05). The soil microbial community diversity increased and then decreased with an increase in gap size. Moreover, the effects of the available phosphorus, soil pH, soil water content, available potassium, nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen on changes in microbial biomass were significant (p < 0.05). The gap area and gap position and their combined interactions also had significant effects on soil nutrients, which impacts the soil microbial community. Medium gaps (130–160 m2) always significantly improved the availability of soil nutrients, and good management practices in secondary forests can provide effective microenvironments for soil microbes.},

We analyze variation in performance among modeling approaches as a function of the relative configuration of these two factors and the spatial extent of training region, with the result that a clear understanding of the abiotic-dispersal configuration is a prerequisite to effective model implementations; the effects of spatial extent of the training region are less consistent and clear.

However, this situation can be largely reversed through appropriate planting density and thinning management. We evaluated the effects of initial planting density and selective thinning management on biomass accumulation and carbon stocks in different plantation compartments, on soil carbon stocks in different stand stages of a chronosequence of evergreen (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations in typical hilly and mountainous areas of Jiangxi Province, Southeast China. The result showed that biomass components and carbon storage of tree, understory and the whole ecosystem in C. lanceolata plantations were significantly higher with than without selective thinning treatment, in the low (1150 trees ha−1) than in the high (2460 trees ha−1) initial density in our study. Aboveground vegetation biomass and carbon storage in C. lanceolata plantations increased with stand stages. However, carbon storage of 0–10 cm and 20–40 cm soil depth decreased with stand stages, which indicated certain degraded characteristics of soil carbon in the C. lanceolata plantations. Interestingly, low initial density increased the biomass and carbon storage of trees, shrubs, herbs and 0–20 cm soil depth greater in the pre-mature and mature stands compared to high initial density. Furthermore, these positive effects of low density increased with selective thinning. According to regressions and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), increment in carbon of trees and 0–10 cm soil with the stand age were significantly higher in the low initial density and with selective thinning than in other three treatments. Therefore, selected thinning and relatively appropriate density might have a significantly positive role in carbon storage of the ecosystem in different stand ages, especially showing a increasing trend of soil carbon. Our results provide the important evidence for selective thinning management of C. lanceolata plantations with regeneration, which plays an important role in improving the carbon storage of degraded C. lanceolata plantations.},

   abstract = {The most common tool to predict future changes in species range are species distribution models. These models do, however, often underestimate potential future habitat, as they do not account for phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation, although being the most important processes in the response of tree populations to rapid climate change. Here, we quantify the difference in the predictions of future range for Norway spruce, by (i) deriving a classic, occurrence-based species distribution model (OccurrenceSDM), and (ii) analysing the variation in juvenile tree height and translating this to species occurrence (TraitSDM). Making use of 32 site locations of the most comprehensive European trial series that includes 1,100 provenances of Norway spruce originating from its natural and further beyond from its largely extended, artificial distribution, we fit a universal response function to quantify growth as a function of site and provenance climate. Both the OccurrenceSDM and TraitSDM show a substantial retreat towards the northern latitudes and higher elevations (−55 and −43%, respectively, by the 2080s). However, thanks to the species’ particularly high phenotypic plasticity in juvenile height growth, the decline is delayed. The TraitSDM identifies increasing summer heat paired with decreasing water availability as the main climatic variable that restricts growth, while a prolonged frost-free period enables a longer period of active growth and therefore increasing growth potential within the restricted, remaining area. Clear signals of local adaptation to climatic clines spanning the entire range are barely detectable, as they are disguised by a latitudinal cline. This cline strongly reflects population differentiation for the Baltic domain, but fails to capture the high phenotypic variation associated to the geographic heterogeneity in the Central European mountain ranges paired with the species history of postglacial migration. Still the model is used to provide recommendations of optimal provenance choice for future climate conditions. In essence, assisted migration may not decrease the predicted range decline of Norway spruce, but may help to capitalize on potential opportunities for increased growth associated with warmer climates.},

We developed models to evaluate potential shifts for 80 individual tree species in the eastern United States. First, environmental factors associated with current ranges of tree species were assessed using geographic information systems (GIS) in conjunction with regression tree analysis (RTA). The method was then extended to better understand the potential of species to survive and/or migrate under a changed climate. We collected, summarized, and analyzed data for climate, soils, land use, elevation, and species assemblages for >2100 counties east of the 100th meridian. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data for >100 000 forested plots in the East provided the tree species range and abundance information for the trees. RTA was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution as well as predict the future potential distributions under two scenarios of climate change with twofold increases in the level of atmospheric CO2. Validation measures prove the utility of the RTA modeling approach for mapping current tree importance values across large areas, leading to increased confidence in the predictions of potential future species distributions. With our analysis of potential effects, we show that roughly 30 species could expand their range and/or weighted importance at least 10%, while an additional 30 species could decrease by at least 10%, following equilibrium after a changed climate. Depending on the global change scenario used, 4-9 species would potentially move out of the United States to the north. Nearly half of the species assessed (36 out of 80) showed the potential for the ecological optima to shift at least 100 km to the north, including seven that could move >250 km. Given these potential future distributions, actual species redistributions will be controlled by migration rates possible through fragmented landscapes.},

Similar patterns of clinal variation have been observed along latitudinal and elevational gradients in common garden experiments for many temperate and boreal species.

In recent decades, experimental design, phenotyping methods, climatic data and statistical analyses have improved greatly and refined but not radically changed knowledge of clines. The maintenance of local adaptation despite high gene flow suggests selection for local adaptation to climate is strong. Concerns over maladaptation resulting from climate change have motivated many new genecological and population genomics studies; however, few jurisdictions have implemented assisted gene flow (AGF), the translocation of pre-adapted individuals to facilitate adaptation of planted forests to climate change. Here, we provide evidence that temperate tree species show clines along climatic gradients sufficiently similar for average patterns or climate models to guide AGF in the absence of species-specific knowledge. Composite provenancing of multiple seed sources can be used to increase diversity and buffer against future climate uncertainty.

   abstract = {Climate change over the past ,30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species 1,2 and has been implicated in one species-level extinction 3. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (,18%) than mid-range (,24%) and maximum-change (,35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration. The responsiveness of species to recent 1-3 and past 4,5 climate change raises the possibility that anthropogenic climate change could act as a major cause of extinctions in the near future, with the Earth set to become warmer than at any period in the past 1-40 Myr (ref. 6). Here we use projections of the future distributions of 1,103 animal and plant species to provide 'first-pass' estimates of extinction probabilities associated with climate change scenarios for 2050. For each species we use the modelled association between current climates (such as temperature, precipitation and seasonality) and present-day distributions to estimate current distributional areas 7-12. This 'climate envelope' represents the conditions under which populations of a species currently persist in the face of competitors and natural enemies. Future distributions are estimated by assuming that current envelopes are retained and can be projected for future climate scenarios 7-12. We assume that a species either has no limits to dispersal such that its future distribution becomes the entire area projected by the climate envelope model or that it is incapable of dispersal, in which case the new distribution is the overlap between current and future potential distributions (for example, species with little dispersal or that inhabit fragmented landscapes) 11. Reality for most species is likely to fall between these extremes. We explore three methods to estimate extinction, based on the species-area relationship, which is a well-established empirical power-law relationship describing how the number of species relates to area (S ¼ cA z , where S is the number of species, A is area, and c and z are constants) 13. This relationship predicts adequately the numbers of species that become extinct or threatened when the area available to them is reduced by habitat destruction 14,15. Extinctions arising from area reductions should apply regardless of whether the cause of distribution loss is habitat destruction or climatic unsuitability. Because climate change can affect the distributional area of each species independently, classical community-level approaches need to be modified (see Methods). In method 1 we use changes in the summed distribution areas of all species. This is consistent with the traditional species-area approach: on average, the destruction of half of a habitat results in the loss of half of the distribution area summed across all species restricted to that habitat. However, this analysis tends to be weighted towards species with large distribu-tional areas. To address this, in method 2 we use the average proportional loss of the distribution area of each species to estimate the fraction of species predicted to become extinct. This approach is faithful to the species-area relationship because halving the habitat area leads on average to the proportional loss of half the distribution of each species. Method 3 considers the extinction risk of each species in turn. In classical applications of the species-area approach, the fraction of species predicted to become extinct is equivalent to the mean probability of extinction per species. Thus, in method 3 we estimate the extinction risk of each species separately by substituting its area loss in the species-area relationship, before averaging across species (see Methods). Our conclusions are not dependent on which of these methods is used. We use z ¼ 0.25 in the species-area relationship throughout, given its previous success in predicting proportions of threatened species 14,15 , but our qualitative conclusions are not dependent on choice of z (Supplementary Information). As there are gaps in the data (not all dispersal/climate scenarios were available for each region), a logit-linear model is fitted to the extinction risk data to produce estimates for missing values in the extinction risk table (Table 1). Balanced estimates of extinction risk, averaged across all data sets, can then be calculated for each scenario. For projections of maximum expected climate change, we estimate species-level extinction across species included in the study to be 21-32% (range of the three methods) with universal dispersal, and 38-52% for no dispersal (Table 1). For projections of mid-range climate change, estimates are 15-20% with dispersal and 26-37% without dispersal (Table 1). Estimates for minimum expected climate change are 9-13% extinction with dispersal and 22-31% without dispersal. Projected extinction varies between parts of the world and between taxonomic groups (Table 1), so our estimates are affected by the data available. The species-area methods differ from one another by up to 1.41-fold (method 1 versus method 3) in estimated extinction, whereas the two dispersal scenarios produce a 1.98-fold difference, and the three climate scenarios generate 2.05-fold variation. letters to nature NATURE | VOL 427 | 8 JANUARY 2004 | www.nature.com/nature 145},

   abstract = {The most common tool to predict future changes in species range are species distribution models. These models do, however, often underestimate potential future habitat, as they do not account for phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation, although being the most important processes in the response of tree populations to rapid climate change. Here, we quantify the difference in the predictions of future range for Norway spruce, by (i) deriving a classic, occurrence-based species distribution model (OccurrenceSDM), and (ii) analysing the variation in juvenile tree height and translating this to species occurrence (TraitSDM). Making use of 32 site locations of the most comprehensive European trial series that includes 1,100 provenances of Norway spruce originating from its natural and further beyond from its largely extended, artificial distribution, we fit a universal response function to quantify growth as a function of site and provenance climate. Both the OccurrenceSDM and TraitSDM show a substantial retreat towards the northern latitudes and higher elevations (−55 and −43%, respectively, by the 2080s). However, thanks to the species’ particularly high phenotypic plasticity in juvenile height growth, the decline is delayed. The TraitSDM identifies increasing summer heat paired with decreasing water availability as the main climatic variable that restricts growth, while a prolonged frost-free period enables a longer period of active growth and therefore increasing growth potential within the restricted, remaining area. Clear signals of local adaptation to climatic clines spanning the entire range are barely detectable, as they are disguised by a latitudinal cline. This cline strongly reflects population differentiation for the Baltic domain, but fails to capture the high phenotypic variation associated to the geographic heterogeneity in the Central European mountain ranges paired with the species history of postglacial migration. Still the model is used to provide recommendations of optimal provenance choice for future climate conditions. In essence, assisted migration may not decrease the predicted range decline of Norway spruce, but may help to capitalize on potential opportunities for increased growth associated with warmer climates.},

   abstract = {Climate change predictions derived from coupled carbon-climate models are highly dependent on assumptions about feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere. One critical feedback occurs if C uptake by the biosphere increases in response to the fossil-fuel driven increase in atmospheric [CO 2] (''CO2 fertiliza-tion''), thereby slowing the rate of increase in atmospheric [CO 2]. Carbon exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere are often first represented in models as net primary productivity (NPP). However, the contribution of CO 2 fertilization to the future global C cycle has been uncertain, especially in forest ecosystems that dominate global NPP, and models that include a feedback between terrestrial biosphere metabolism and atmospheric [CO 2] are poorly constrained by experimental evidence. We analyzed the response of NPP to elevated CO 2 (550 ppm) in four free-air CO 2 enrichment experiments in forest stands. We show that the response of forest NPP to elevated [CO 2] is highly conserved across a broad range of productivity, with a stimulation at the median of 23 2%. At low leaf area indices, a large portion of the response was attributable to increased light absorption, but as leaf area indices increased, the response to elevated [CO 2] was wholly caused by increased light-use efficiency. The surprising consistency of response across diverse sites provides a benchmark to evaluate predictions of ecosystem and global models and allows us now to focus on unresolved questions about carbon partitioning and retention, and spatial variation in NPP response caused by availability of other growth limiting resources. CO2 fertilization global change leaf area index net primary productivity A nalysis and prediction of the effects of human activities, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, on climate and the biological, physical, and social responses to changing climate require an integrated view of the complex interactions between the biosphere and atmosphere. Carbon cycle models are now being coupled to atmosphere-ocean general circulation climate models to achieve a dynamic analysis of the relationships between C emissions, atmospheric chemistry, biosphere activity, and climatic change (1-3). Exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere are represented in models using empirical and theoretical expressions of net primary productivity (NPP), the net fixation of C by green plants into organic matter, or the difference between photosynthesis and plant respiration. Because the photosynthetic uptake of carbon that drives NPP is not saturated at current atmospheric concentrations (4), NPP should increase as fossil-fuel combustion adds to the atmospheric [CO 2 ]. Increased C uptake into the biosphere in response to rising [CO 2 ] (''CO 2 fertilization'') can create a negative feedback that slows the rate of increase in atmospheric [CO 2 ] (3, 5). Hence, assumptions regarding CO 2 fertilization of the terrestrial biosphere greatly affect predictions of future atmospheric [CO 2 ] (3). The response of NPP to [CO 2 ] in models can be prescribed (1) or calculated through a mechanistic representation (3, 5). In either case, the predicted responses of net ecosystem production (or NPP minus heterotrophic respiration), net C exchange with the atmosphere, and the climatic responses to atmospheric [CO 2 ] will be incorrect if the magnitude of the CO 2 fertilization effect is not represented accurately. Experimental data should provide useful guidance to models, thereby increasing our confidence in model predictions. Experiments have unequivocally shown that plants can grow faster and larger in a CO 2-enriched atmosphere (6-8), and the mechanisms of response are well understood (4). The relevance of this evidence to prediction of global C budgets over decadal time frames, however, may be limited. As spatial and temporal scales increase beyond what can be captured in experiments, modifying influences of resource availability and biogeochemical feedbacks within the ecosystem become increasingly important, and these tend to diminish the simple response to elevated [CO 2 ] observed in small-scale experiments. The problem is especially severe with forests because of the inherent difficulty in conducting relevant experiments at appropriate spatial and temporal scales with large and long-lived organisms and complex ecosystems. Nevertheless , the potential responses of forests to rising [CO 2 ] cannot be ignored in global C cycling analyses and predictions of climatic change because forest ecosystems contribute 50% of global NPP and 80% of terrestrial NPP (9). With the development of Free-Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) technology (10, 11), it is now possible to elevate atmospheric [CO 2 ] in large plots in intact forest ecosystems without altering other microclimatic and biotic variables (12). Recognizing that the results from any single experiment may not be broadly representative, here we provide the an analysis of NPP data from the four FACE experiments operating in forest stands.

   abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

Warmer and drier conditions particularly facilitate fire, drought and insect disturbances, while warmer and wetter conditions increase disturbances from wind and pathogens. Widespread interactions between agents are likely to amplify disturbances, while indirect climate effects such as vegetation changes can dampen long-term disturbance sensitivities to climate.

   abstract = {The genetic background of transplants used to create or augment wild populations may affect the long-term success of restored populations. If seed sources are from differently adapted populations, then the relative performance of progeny from crosses among populations may decrease with an increase in genetic differences of parents and in the differences of parental environments to the transplant location. We evaluated the potential for such outbreeding depression by hybridizing individuals from six different populations of Lotus scoparius var. scoparius and L. s. var. brevialatus. We used allozyme data to calculate genetic distances between source populations, and compiled climatic data and measured soil traits to estimate environmental distances between source populations. We found significant outbreeding depression following controlled crosses. In the greenhouse, the success of crosses (seeds/flower X seedlings/seed) decreased with increasing genetic distance between populations revealing genetically based outbreeding depression unrelated to local adaptation. After outplanting to one native site (in situ common garden), field cumulative fitness of progeny (survival X fruit production) decreased significantly with mean environmental distance of the parental populations to the transplant site, but not with genetic distance between the crossed populations. This result is consistent with a disruption of local adaptation. At the second, ecologically contrasting common garden, where low survival reduced statistical power, field cumulative fitness (survival X progeny height) did not decrease significantly with either environmental distance or genetic distance. Overall, intervariety crosses were 40 and 50% as fit (seeds/flower X seedlings/seed X survival X fruits at the first garden or X height at the second) as intravariety crosses. These results suggest that the cumulative outbreeding depression was caused by a combination of genetically based ecological differences among populations and other genomic coadaptation. We conclude that mixing genetically differentiated seed sources of Lotus scoparius may significantly lower the fitness of augmented or restored populations. Genetic and environmental similarities of source populations relative to the transplant site should be considered when choosing source materials, a practice recommended by recent seed transfer policies. Geographic separation was not a good surrogate for either of these measures.},

En el concepto clásico de restauración se pretende recuperar el ecosistema degradado a las mismas condiciones de un referente histórico.

   abstract = {1. Large differences exist in the predictions of plant responses to climate change among models that consider population variation and those that do not. Models that treat species as homogeneous entities typically predict net positive impacts of climate change on temperate forest productivity, while most studies that consider adaptive genetic variation within species conclude that the impacts of climate change on forest productivity will be negative. 2. We present a modelling approach that predicts plant responses to climate change using both ecological and genetic variables. The model uses growth data from multi-site provenance trials together with climate data for provenance source locations and test sites to predict distribution and productivity of tree populations under climate change. We used an extensive lodgepole pine Pinus contorta provenance data set to illustrate the model. 3. Spatially explicit predictions of the impacts of climate change on production were developed and suggested that different populations of lodgepole pine will respond very differently to climate change. Large production losses will be seen in many areas, although modest production increases may occur in some areas by 2085. The model further projects a significant redistribution of the species' potential habitat northwards and upwards in altitude over the next several decades. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study points to the need to consider population differences when modelling biotic responses to climate change, and suggests that climate change will render populations maladapted in many areas. The model also provides a key tool potentially to mitigate climate change impacts by identifying populations expected to be best adapted throughout the next generation of forests. Finally, the study highlights the value of wide-ranging long-term provenance tests in addressing key issues in ecology and climate change. © 2008 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Locally adapted temperate tree populations exhibit genetic trade-offs among climate-related traits that can be exacerbated by selective breeding and are challenging to manage under climate change. To inform climatically adaptive forest management, we investigated the genetic architecture and impacts of selective breeding on four climate-related traits in 105 natural and 20 selectively bred lodge-pole pine populations from western Canada. Growth, cold injury, growth initiation, and growth cessation phenotypes were tested for associations with 18,600 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in natural populations to identify "positive effect alleles" (PEAs). The effects of artificial selection for faster growth on the frequency of PEAs associated with each trait were quantified in breeding populations from different climates. Substantial shifts in PEA proportions and frequencies were observed across many loci after two generations of selective breeding for height, and responses of phenology-associated PEAs differed strongly among climatic regions. Extensive genetic overlap was evident among traits. Alleles most strongly associated with greater height were often associated with greater cold injury and delayed phenology, although it is unclear whether potential trade-offs arose directly from pleiotropy or indirectly via genetic linkage. Modest variation in multilocus PEA frequencies among populations was associated with large phenotypic differences and strong climatic gradients, providing support for assisted gene flow polices. Relationships among genotypes, phenotypes, and climate in natural populations were maintained or strengthened by selective breeding. However, future adaptive phenotypes and assisted gene flow may be compromised if selective breeding further increases the PEA frequencies of SNPs involved in adaptive trade-offs among climate-related traits. climatic adaptation | selective breeding | lodgepole pine | positive effect alleles | polygenic traits L ocal adaptation of climate-related traits in widespread temperate conifers has been demonstrated for centuries using extensive long-term common garden experiments (1, 2). As early as the 17th century, foresters were instructed to recognize variation in desirable traits and select seed from trees with favorable phenotypes (3). Modern tree improvement programs systematically select upon genetic variation, primarily to achieve growth gains and meet economic objectives. Estimates of genetic variation and gains from selection made using quantitative genetic models assume many anonymous loci of small effect underlie both variation in continuously distributed phenotypes and their responses to selective breeding. However, the type, quantity, effect size, distribution , and dynamics of genes underlying locally adaptive pheno-typic variation and responses to selective breeding in forest trees are still poorly understood (4). Directional selection over hundreds or thousands of generations has led to genomic features of domestication in agricultural crops including simplified genetic architectures underlying many traits, reduced genome-wide diversity, and numerous selective sweeps (5-7). Beyond high-gain, short-rotation clonal forestry [e.g., Eu-calyptus spp. (8)], we know little about the effects of artificial selection on adaptive genetic variation in forest trees, yet many tree species undergo some degree of selective breeding. Two or three generations of conifer breeding is not expected to have the same magnitude of genetic effects seen in domesticated crops, but if artificial selection for increased productivity is detectable in conifer genomes, it may expose genetic relationships and potential sources of trade-offs between growth and climatically adaptive phenotypes. Climate-related adaptive traits are often intercorrelated due to pleiotropy, natural selection, or linkage disequilibrium (LD), so that strong directional selection on one trait can cause correlated responses in others. Pleiotropic allelic variants associated with phenotypes do not function in isolation. Antagonistic pleiotropic effects among traits can generate adaptive trade-offs among traits within populations, and limit gains from selection on a focal trait (9). Trait-trait correlations can also arise through strong selection acting in parallel on unlinked loci or from LD mediated by physical linkage of loci on chromosomes. Average genome-wide LD estimates in conifers appear to be low (10, 11) Significance Temperate trees originating from warmer localities usually grow faster and acclimate to winter later than trees of the same species from colder localities. However, when trees are selected for faster growth, are climatically adaptive genes and traits affected? Our research demonstrates a simple, sensitive, broadly applicable, and elusive approach to integrating complex polygenic variation into applied environmental management. We show that selective breeding increases allele frequencies of many trait-associated genes, and that alleles that increase most display strong genetic linkage and potential trade-offs among traits. Increasing tree growth while maintaining adaptation is essential to reforestation in a changing climate, but this may be challenging because trait-associated genetic variation that underpins climate adaptation is responsive to selection for tree growth.

   abstract = {Identifying populations within tree species potentially adapted to future climatic conditions is an important requirement for reforestation and assisted migration programmes. Such populations can be identified either by empirical response functions based on correlations of quantitative traits with climate variables or by climate envelope models that compare the climate of seed sources and potential growing areas. In the present study, we analyzed the intraspecific variation in climate growth response of Douglas-fir planted within the non-analogous climate conditions of Central and continental Europe. With data from 50 common garden trials, we developed Universal Response Functions (URF) for tree height and mean basal area and compared the growth performance of the selected best performing populations with that of populations identified through a climate envelope approach. Climate variables of the trial location were found to be stronger predictors of growth performance than climate variables of the population origin. Although the precipitation regime of the population sources varied strongly none of the precipitation related climate variables of population origin was found to be significant within the models. Overall, the URFs explained more than 88% of variation in growth performance. Populations identified by the URF models originate from western Cascades and coastal areas of Washington and Oregon and show significantly higher growth performance than populations identified by the climate envelope approach under both current and climate change scenarios. The URFs predict decreasing growth performance at low and middle elevations of the case study area, but increasing growth performance on high elevation sites. Our analysis suggests that population recommendations based on empirical approaches should be preferred and population selections by climate envelope models without considering climatic constrains of growth performance should be carefully appraised before transferring populations to planting locations with novel or dissimilar climate.

   abstract = {Climate is a major environmental factor affecting the phenotype of trees and is also a critical agent of natural selection that has molded among-population genetic variation. Population response functions describe the environmental effect of planting site climates on the performance of a single population, whereas transfer functions describe among-population genetic variation molded by natural selection for climate. Although these approaches are widely used to predict the responses of trees to climate change, both have limitations. We present a novel approach that integrates both genetic and environmental effects into a single "universal response function" (URF) to better predict the influence of climate on phenotypes. Using a large lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) field transplant experiment composed of 140 populations planted on 62 sites to demonstrate the methodology, we show that the URF makes full use of data from provenance trials to: (1) improve predictions of climate change impacts on phenotypes; (2) reduce the size and cost of future provenance trials without compromising predictive power; (3) more fully exploit existing, less comprehensive provenance tests; (4) quantify and compare environmental and genetic effects of climate on population performance; and (5) predict the performance of any population growing in any climate. Finally, we discuss how the last attribute allows the URF to be used as a mechanistic model to predict population and species ranges for the future and to guide assisted migration of seed for reforestation, restoration, or afforestation and genetic conservation in a changing climate. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Quantifying their capacity to adjust and whether the response is species- or population-specific is important to guide forest management strategies. New analyses of historic provenance tests data are yielding relevant insights about these responses. Yet, differences between the objectives used to design the experiments and current objectives impose limitations to what can be learned from them. Our objectives are (i) to discuss the possibilities and limitations of using such data to quantify growth responses to changes in climate and (ii) to present a modeling approach that creates a species- and population-specific model. We illustrate the modeling approach for Larix occidentalis Nutt. We conclude that the reanalysis of historic provenance tests data can lead to the identification of species that have population-specific growth responses to changes in climate, provide estimates of optimum transfer distance for populations and species, and provide estimates of growth changes under different climate change scenarios. Using mixed-effects modeling techniques is a sound statistical approach to overcome some of the limitations of the data. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Knowledge about the local adaptation and response of forest tree populations to the climate is important for assessing the impact of climate change and developing adaptive genetic resource management strategies. However, such information is not available for most plant species. Here, based on 69 provenances tested at 19 common garden experimental sites, we developed a universal response function (URF) for tree height at seven years of age for the important and wide-spread native Chinese tree species Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco. URF was recently used to predict the potential growth response of a population originating from any climate and growing in any climate conditions. The developed model integrated both genetic and environmental effects, and explained 55% of the total variation in tree height observed among provenances and test sites in China. We found that local provenances performed better than non-local counterparts in habitats located in central, eastern, and southwestern China, showing the evidence of local adaptation as compared to other regions. In contrast, non-local provenances outperformed local ones in peripheral areas in northern and northwestern China, suggesting an adaptational lag in these areas. Future projections suggest that the suitable habitat areas of P. orientalis would expand by 15%-39% and shift northward by 0.8-3 degrees in latitude; however, the projected tree height of this species would decline by 4%-8% if local provenances were used. If optimal provenances were used, tree height growth could be improved by 13%-15%, along with 59%-71% suitable habitat expansion. Thus, assisted migration with properly selected seed sources would be effective in avoiding maladaptation in new plantations under a changing climate for P. orientalis.},

   abstract = {Intraspecific variation plays a critical role in extant and future forest responses to climate change. Forest tree species with wide climatic niches rely on the intraspecific variation resulting from genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to accommodate spatial and temporal climate variability. A centuries-old legacy of forest ecological genetics and provenance trials has provided a strong foundation upon which to continue building on this knowledge, which is critical to maintain climate-adapted forests. Our overall objective is to understand forest trees intraspecific responses to climate across species and biomes, while our specific objectives are to describe ecological genetics models used to build our foundational knowledge, summarize modeling approaches that have expanded the traditional toolset, and extensively review the literature from 1994 to 2021 to highlight the main contributions of this legacy and the new analyzes of provenance trials. We reviewed 103 studies comprising at least three common gardens, which covered 58 forest tree species, 28 of them with range-wide studies. Although studies using provenance trial data cover mostly commercially important forest tree species from temperate and boreal biomes, this synthesis provides a global overview of forest tree species adaptation to climate. We found that evidence for genetic adaptation to local climate is commonly present in the species studied (79%), being more common in conifers (87.5%) than in broadleaf species (67%). In 57% of the species, clines in fitness-related traits were associated with temperature variables, in 14% of the species with precipitation, and in 25% of the species with both. Evidence of adaptation lags was found in 50% of the species with range-wide studies. We conclude that ecological genetics models and analysis of provenance trial data provide excellent insights on intraspecific genetic variation, whereas the role and limits of phenotypic plasticity, which will likely determine the fate of extant forests, is vastly understudied.},

On patchy compared with continuous serpentine, alpha diversity (local) was 32% lower, gamma diversity (total) was 17% higher, and beta diversity (differentiation in species composition among sites) was 72% higher. Of the increased beta diversity on patches, most (62%) occurred at the 'local' scale of patches 50-3200 m apart, and only 10% occurred at the scale of clusters of patches 16-45 km apart. Complementarity, an alternative measure of beta diversity, showed the same patterns. Woody plants on nonserpentine soils showed diversity patterns similar to those on patchy serpentine, i.e., lower alpha and higher beta and gamma diversity relative to continuous serpentine. Nonserpentine plants showed a stronger response to environmental gradients than did serpentine plants. For the woody plant community, on serpentine soils, the natural large-scale patchiness of the habitat leads to lower local diversity but higher differentiation and regional diversity. The increased regional diversity appears to be almost entirely the result of edge effects, rather than of 'patchy coexistence' as described by metacommunity models.},

To compensate for increased salivation during sedation, which would enable an accelerated flux of applied virus to the gastrointestinal tract, we injected intraveneously an anti-<:holinergic glycopyrroniumbromide just before virus inoculation. For atraumatic exposure of the palatine and lingual tonsils, a cotton-wool swab was saturated with phosphate-buffered saline, squeezed out, and then saturated with an undiluted or 1 :10 diluted cell-free virus suspension. Thereafter, these tonsillar regions were repeatedly touched lightly in three 5-min intervals with freshly saturated swabs, finally applying a total volume of-SO to 80 µl of virus suspension. This applied amount of virus was calculated by weighing the swabs after use and corresponded to-2000 to 3000 TCID 50 with undiluted virus \{which corresponds to amounts used in many studies of urethral, rectal. and vaginal transmission) and-200 to 300 TCID 50 with the diluted virus. At the time of inoculation, no obvious lesions or gingivitis were observed in the oral cavity of any of the animals used. To monitor long-tenm infection by this route, we followed three macaques, two receiving undiluted virus and one 1: 10 diluted virus, for a longer period of time. To determine the site of virus entry and virus spread, we euthanisized another eight monkeys in the acute phase after tonsillar exposure, two each on days 2, 3, and 4 and one each on days 7 and 23 after inoculation. Tonsillar infection was compared with the iv route by infecting other animals intravenously with a similar dose of 2000 TCID 50 of the same virus stock and monitoring them with virologic assays for several weeks and by histology in one animal on day 4. At necropsy lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs were sampled from various body locations for virus isolation, histology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. 20. Cell-associated viral loads were detenmined by limiting dilution coculture with mononuclear cells from blood and lymphoid organs \{35). PBMCs were separated from whole citrated blood by Ficoll density gradient centrif-ugation. To prepare mononuclear cells from lymphoid organs (tonsils, lymph nodes from different regions, spleen, thymus, and Peyer's patches), we forced the respective tissues through commercial nylon sieves (100-µm mesh, Falcon) and processed them like PBMCs except for the density gradient centrifugation. This cen-trifugation step was only necessary for spleen cells because of the red blood cell contamination. After separation of mononuclear cells, they were simultaneously cocultivated in declining concentrations with human CBl-66 T cells as indicators (35). Cultures were monitored for syncytia formation, and intracellular an-tigen was visualized by an immunoperoxidase assay \{36), with the modification that the T cells were adhered to concanavalin A-<:oated microtitre plates instead of poly-L-lysine-<oated plates. All treated cells were scored under a light microscope, with infected cells being identified by a deep red-brown cytoplasmic staining. The endpoint of the viral load was calculated as described (35, 37\}. Heat-inactivated whole SIV lysate was used in optimal concentrations to coat 96-well microtiter plates to measure serum anti-SIV antibody responses as described \{36). Antigenemia was measured by a commercial HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen test (lnno-genetics, Zwijndrecht, Belgium). To detenmine the absolute CD4 + T cell counts in blood, we stained PBMCs with phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody to CD4 \{OKT 4, Ortho Diagnostics Systems) and analyzed them on an EPICS XL flow cytometer \{Coulter) with gating on lym-phocytes. CD4 + T cell numbers were calculated by multiplying white cell count times lymphocyte percentage in a blood smear times CD4 + T cell percentage by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). 21. C.

Four sections from each tissue per time point were hybridized with an 35 5-labeled, single-stranded, antisense RNA probe of 51Vmac239 \{Lofstrand Labs, Gaithersburg, MD). It was composed of fragments of 1.4 to 2. 7 kb in size, which collectively represent-90% of the SIV genome. As a positive control, cytospin prepartions of SIV-infected PBMCs were REPORTS hybridized, and as a negative control, a sense-strand probe was used. Dewaxed paraffin sections were boiled in a domestic pressure cooker in citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 5 min, chilled down to room temperature, rinsed in water containing 2% diethyl-pyrocarbonate, and prehybridized for 2 hours at 45°C.

Prehybridization was followed by incubation with the hybridization mixture (prehybridiza-tion mixture, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 x 10 6 dpm of probe per milliliter) overnight at 45°C in a moist chamber.

   abstract = {Numerous studies have reported that treelines are moving to higher elevations and higher latitudes. Most treelines are temperature limited and warmer climate expands the area in which trees are capable of growing. Hence, climate change has been assumed to be the main driver behind this treeline movement. The latest review of treeline studies was published in 2009 by Harsch et al. Since then, a plethora of papers have been published studying local treeline migration. Here we bring together this knowledge through a review of 142 treeline related publications, including 477 study locations. We summarize the information known about factors limiting tree-growth at and near treelines. Treeline migration is not only dependent on favorable growing conditions but also requires seedling establishment and survival above the current treeline. These conditions appear to have become favorable at many locations, particularly so in recent years. The review revealed that at 66% of these treeline sites forest cover had increased in elevational or latitudinal extent. The physical form of treelines influences how likely they are to migrate and can be used as an indicator when predicting future treeline movements. Our analysis also revealed that while a greater percentage of elevational treelines are moving, the latitudinal treelines are capable of moving at greater horizontal speed. This can potentially have substantial impacts on ecosystem carbon storage. To conclude the review, we present the three main hypotheses as to whether ecosystem carbon budgets will be reduced, increased or remain the same due to treeline migration. While the answer still remains under debate, we believe that all three hypotheses are likely to apply depending on the encroached ecosystem. Concerningly, evidence is emerging on how treeline migration may turn tundra landscapes from net sinks to net sources of carbon dioxide in the future.},

Environmental differences between the location of origin and the planting (test) site have been calculated by principal component analysis and termed ecological distance, Based on ecological distance values, the growth response of tree populations can be modeled as a function of the test site macroclimate. These models can then be used to predict the effects of climatic change on growth and survival. The growth response model predicts that increasing annual mean temperatures will result in accelerated growth if precipitation is sufficient, but only within the limits characteristic of the species. At the southern limits of distribution, growth and competitive ability of the species will decline, leading to successional changes.},

This paper identifies the potential changes in the future distribution of species under the UKCIP98 climate change scenarios, in order that such changes can be taken into account in conservation management. Location The model was applied to Britain and Ireland. Methods A model based on an artificial neural network was used to predict the changing bioclimate envelopes of species in Britain and Ireland. Fifty-four species representing 15 habitats were modelled. Results The modelled species could be placed into three categories: those losing suitable climate space, those gaining it, and those showing little or no change. When the species were associated with habitats it was found that Arctic-Alpine/montane heath communities were the most sensitive to climate change, followed by pine woodland and beech woodland in southern England. In lowland heath, wet heath, cereal field margins, coastal grazing marsh, drought-prone acid grassland and calcareous grassland, the species either showed little change or an increase in suitable climate space. The other eight habitats showed a mixed response. Conclusions The species show a variety of responses to climate change and thus their current habitat associations may alter. The uncertain future of some species and habitats is highlighted. Conservation policy and practice will need to be revised in the face of climate change.},

The results showed the species Casearia sylvestris, Copaifera langsdorffii and Tapirira guianensis widely occurring in the state of Minas Gerais, including a broad range of environmental variables. Croton floribundus had restricted occurrence in the southern state, showing narrow environmental variation. The resulting algorithms demonstrated greater performance when modeling restricted geographic and environmental species, as well as species occurring with high prevalence in data. The algorithm Random Forest performed better for distribution modeling of all species, although the results varied for each metric and species.

   abstract = {Modelling tree habitat suitability (HS) is a common practice to assess tree species distribution across a broad range of spatial scales. However, it is seldom used to test the extent that modelled HS-scores (probability of species occurrence) can represent on-the-ground measures of species-structural characteristics. In this study, we compare four parametric and non-parametric models generated with the R-package, sdm, to assess the potential for these models to estimate tree species distribution of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] in naturally-growing forests across an extensive landscape. Central to this development are inventory plot data of species presence-absence and four abiotic factors linked to plant growth and distribution. The study's abiotic factors include: (1) photosynthetically active radiation; (2) growing degree-days; (3) relative extractable soil water content; and (4) near-surface wind speed, all expressed spatially at 30-m resolution. To gauge whether modelled HS can explain structural characteristics in balsam fir-dominated stands, field-based estimates of site index (SI) and cumulative aboveground biomass (ABG) were compared against independently-derived HS-scores. The results showed that: (i) random forest was the most successful at representing species distribution of balsam fir among the four methods considered; (ii) overall growing conditions for balsam fir was observed to be most favourable on north-facing slopes, particularly in the northwest part of the target landscape, where near-surface air temperatures are cooler, soils are moderately wetter, and wind speeds are lower; (iii) tree-based calculations of SI were partially characterised by patterns in modelled HS-scores, due to scale differences (i.e., from individual tree to 30-m grid cells) and an inadequate number of sample trees; and (iv) patterns of cumulative AGB were more accurately represented by species HS. Modelled HS-scores, as potential indicators of tree species habitat preference, AGB, and species distribution, can offer key ecological information essential to inform forest management and conservation planning at the landscape level.},

   abstract = {Melia azedarach L. is an important economic tree widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of China and some other countries. However, it is unclear how the species’ suitable habitat will respond to future climate changes. We aimed to select the most accurate one among seven data mining models to predict the current and future suitable habitats for M. azedarach in China. These models include: maximum entropy (MaxEnt), support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), naive bayesian model (NBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). A total of 906 M. azedarach locations were identified, and sixteen climate predictors were used for model building. The models’ validity was assessed using three measures (Area Under the Curves (AUC), kappa, and overall accuracy (OA)). We found that the RF provided the most outstanding performance in prediction power and generalization capacity. The top climate factors affecting the species’ suitable habitats were mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), followed by the number of frost-free days (NFFD), degree-days above 18 °C (DD > 18), temperature difference between MWMT and MCMT, or continentality (TD), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and degree-days below 18 °C (DD < 18). We projected that future suitable habitat of this species would increase under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for the 2011–2040 (2020s), 2041–2070 (2050s), and 2071–2100 (2080s). Our findings are expected to assist in better understanding the impact of climate change on the species and provide scientific basis for its planting and conservation.},

   abstract = {Species climate niche models (CNMs) have been widely used for assessing climate change impact, developing conservation strategies and guiding assisted migration for adaptation to future climates. However, the CNMs built based on species occurrence data only reflect the species’ realized niche, which can overestimate the potential loss of suitable habitat of existing forests and underestimate the potential of assisted migration to mitigate climate change. In this study, we explored building a fundamental climate niche model using widely available species occurrence data with two important forest tree species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Franco.), which were introduced to many countries worldwide. We first compared and optimized three individual modeling techniques and their ensemble by adjusting the ratio of presence to absence (p/a) observations using an innovative approach to predict the realized climate niche of the two species. We then extended the realized climate niches to their fundamental niches by determining a new cut-off threshold based on species occurrence data beyond the native distributions. We found that the ensemble model comprising Random Forest and Maxent had the best performance and identified a common cut-off threshold of 0.3 for predicting the fundamental climate niches of the two species, which is likely applicable to other species. We then predicted the fundamental climate niches of the two species under current and future climate conditions. Our study demonstrated a novel approach for predicting species’ fundamental climate niche with high accuracy using only species occurrence data, including both presence and absence data points. It provided a new tool for assessing climate change impact on the future loss of existing forests and implementing assisted migration for better adapting to future climates.},

General trends showed an overall decrease in both species' topo-climatic suitability and indicated that the Pyrenees will play a crucial role as a climatic refuge. The modeling approaches markedly differed, however, in their current and future spatial agreement.

Analyses of the communities were based on a gridded sample of ca. 140,000 points, while those for the species used presence-absence data from ca. 120,000 locations. Independent variables included 35 simple expressions of temperature and precipitation and their interactions. Classification errors for community models averaged 19%, but the errors were reduced by half when adjusted for misalignment between geographic data sets. Errors of omission for species-specific models approached 0, while errors of commission were less than 9%. Mapped climate profiles of the species were in solid agreement with range maps. Climate variables of most importance for segregating the communities were those that generally differentiate maritime, continental, and monsoonal climates, while those of importance for predicting the occurrence of species varied among species but consistently implicated the periodicity of precipitation and temperature-precipitation interactions. Projections showed that unmitigated global warming should increase the abundance primarily of the montane forest and grassland community profiles at the expense largely of those of the subalpine, alpine, and tundra communities but also that of the arid woodlands. However, the climate of 47% of the future landscape may be extramural to contemporary community profiles. Effects projected on the spatial distribution of species-specific profiles were varied, but shifts in space and altitude would be extensive. Species-specific projections were not necessarily consistent with those of their communities. © 2006 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

A variety of statistical methods have been developed for species distribution modelling. A general problem with most of these habitat modelling approaches is that the estimated response curves can display biologically implausible shapes which do not respect ecological niche theory. This work proposes using shape-constrained generalized additive models (SC-GAMs) to build species distribution models under the ecological niche theory framework, imposing concavity constraints in the linear predictor scale. Based on a simulation study and a real data application, we compared performance with respect to other regression models without shape-constraints (such as standard GLMs and GAMs with varying degrees of freedom) and also to models based on so-called “Plateau” climate-envelopes. The imposition of concavity for response curves resulted in a good balance between the goodness of fit (GOF) and agreement with ecological niche theory. The approach has been applied to fit distribution models for three fish species given several environmental variables.},

BIOMOD capitalizes on the different techniques used in static modelling to provide spatial predictions. It computes, for each species and in the same package, the four most widely used modelling techniques in species predictions, namely Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Classification and Regression Tree analysis (CART) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). BIOMOD was applied to 61 species of trees in Europe using climatic quantities as explanatory variables of current distributions. On average, all the different modelling methods yielded very good agreement between observed and predicted distributions. However, the relative performance of different techniques was idiosyncratic across species, suggesting that the most accurate model varies between species. The results of this evaluation also highlight that slight differences between current predictions from different modelling techniques are exacerbated in future projections. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the reliability of alternative projections without validation techniques or expert opinion. It is concluded that rather than using a single modelling technique to predict the distribution of several species, it would be more reliable to use a framework assessing different models for each species and selecting the most accurate one using both evaluation methods and expert knowledge.},

This is because it is expected to balance accuracy and robustness of SDM models. However, there are little available data regarding the spatial similarity of the combined distribution maps generated by different consensus approaches. Here, using eight niche-based models, nine split-sample calibration bouts (or nine random model-training subsets), and nine climate change scenarios, the distributions of 32 forest tree species in China were simulated under current and future climate conditions. The forecasting ensembles were combined to determine final consensual prediction maps for target species using three simple consensus approaches (average, frequency, and median [PCA]). Species' geographic ranges changed (area change and shifting distance) in response to climate change, but the three consensual projections did not differ significantly with respect to how much or in which direction, but they did differ with respect to the spatial similarity of the three consensual predictions. Incongruent areas were observed primarily at the edges of species' ranges. Multiple stepwise regression models showed the three factors (niche marginality and specialization, and niche model accuracy) to be related to the observed variations in consensual prediction maps among consensus approaches. Spatial correspondence among prediction maps was the highest when niche model accuracy was high and marginality and specialization were low. The difference in spatial predictions suggested that more attention should be paid to the range of spatial uncertainty before any decisions regarding specialist species can be made based on map outputs. The niche properties and single-model predictive performance provide promising insights that may further understanding of uncertainties in SDM.},

In the context of Species Distribution Models (SDM) and in line with predictions of landscape ecology and island biogeography, CNN could grasp how local landscape structure affects prediction of species occurrence in SDMs. The prediction can thus reflect the signatures of entangled ecological processes. Although previous machine-learning based SDMs can learn complex influences of environmental predictors, they cannot acknowledge the influence of environmental structure in local landscapes (hence denoted “punctual models”). In this study, we applied CNNs to a large dataset of plant occurrences in France (GBIF), on a large taxonomical scale, to predict ranked relative probability of species (by joint learning) to any geographical position. We examined the way local environmental landscapes improve prediction by performing alternative CNN models deprived of information on landscape heterogeneity and structure (“ablation experiments”). We found that the landscape structure around location crucially contributed to improve predictive performance of CNN-SDMs. CNN models can classify the predicted distributions of many species, as other joint modelling approaches, but they further prove efficient in identifying the influence of local environmental landscapes. CNN can then represent signatures of spatially structured environmental drivers. The prediction gain is noticeable for rare species, which open promising perspectives for biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies. Therefore, the approach is of both theoretical and practical interest. We discuss the way to test hypotheses on the patterns learnt by CNN, which should be essential for further interpretation of the ecological processes at play.},

   abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions are expected to globally impact the biological function, community structure, and spatial distribution of biodiversity. Many existing studies explore the effect of climate change on biodiversity, generally at a single spatial scale. This study explores the potential effects of climate change on the habitat suitability of seven tree species at two distinct spatial scales: the Coronado National Forest (CNF), a local management area, and the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), an ecoregional extent. Habitat suitability was determined by extrapolating Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) based on citizen-science tree occurrence records into future climatic conditions using projected 30-year normals for two anthropogenic emissions scenarios through the end of the century. These ENMs, examined at a spatial resolution of 1 km2, are constructed using a mean average ensemble of three commonly used machine learning algorithms. The results show that habitat suitability is expected to decrease for all seven tree species at varying degrees. Results also show that climate-forcing scenario choice appears to be far less important for understanding changes in species habitat suitability than the spatial scale of modeling extent. Additionally, we observed non-linear changes in tree species habitat suitability within the SMO and CNF dependent on forest community type, latitude, and elevational gradient. The paper concludes with a discussion of the necessary steps to verify the estimated alters of these tree species under climate change. Most importantly, provides a framework for characterizing habitat suitability across spatial scales.},

A total of 506 G. travancorica cluster locations were surveyed and used for this study with thirty different ecogeographic, edaphic and bioclimatic environmental parameters. After a preliminary investigation using multi-collinearity analysis, soil parameter variables like pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), silt and clay content are used for final modelling. Factor analysis of ecological niche revealed the soil parameters like pH, CEC, silt and clay content as the key predictors. The result is validated using true skill statistics, sensitivity, specificity, kappa statistic and AUC-ROC. Results of the present study show that DNN have exceptional prediction performance, demonstrated by its AUC score of 0.959. DNN model projected 32.37% (938.18 km2) of the study region to have a ‘highly suitable habitat’, whereas 67.63% (1960.82 km2) was classified as having ‘low habitat suitability’. Besides, back-to-field assessments have also proven DNN's potential in predicting the habitat suitability of G. travancorica. The study results will facilitate the prioritization of conservation and seedling restoration strategies.

We developed models to evaluate potential shifts for 80 individual tree species in the eastern United States. First, environmental factors associated with current ranges of tree species were assessed using geographic information systems (GIS) in conjunction with regression tree analysis (RTA). The method was then extended to better understand the potential of species to survive and/or migrate under a changed climate. We collected, summarized, and analyzed data for climate, soils, land use, elevation, and species assemblages for >2100 counties east of the 100th meridian. Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data for >100 000 forested plots in the East provided the tree species range and abundance information for the trees. RTA was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution as well as predict the future potential distributions under two scenarios of climate change with twofold increases in the level of atmospheric CO2. Validation measures prove the utility of the RTA modeling approach for mapping current tree importance values across large areas, leading to increased confidence in the predictions of potential future species distributions. With our analysis of potential effects, we show that roughly 30 species could expand their range and/or weighted importance at least 10%, while an additional 30 species could decrease by at least 10%, following equilibrium after a changed climate. Depending on the global change scenario used, 4-9 species would potentially move out of the United States to the north. Nearly half of the species assessed (36 out of 80) showed the potential for the ecological optima to shift at least 100 km to the north, including seven that could move >250 km. Given these potential future distributions, actual species redistributions will be controlled by migration rates possible through fragmented landscapes.},

Nine bioclimatic zones and 41 strata were recognized in Myanmar, but their representation in the protected area system varied greatly, with the driest zones especially underrepresented. Under climate change, most zones will shift upslope, with some protected areas projected to change entirely to a new bioclimate. Potential impacts on biodiversity include mountaintop extinctions of species endemic to isolated peaks, loss of climate specialists from small protected areas and those with little elevational range, and woody encroachment into savannas and open forests as a result of both climate change and rising atmospheric CO2.

This study aimed to evaluate the consequences of climate change on geographical distributions and habitat suitability of 14 threatened forest tree species in the Philippines. Based on the principle of maximum entropy, it utilized a machine algorithm called Maxent to estimate a target probability distribution and habitat suitability of the selected species. Threatened forest tree species occurrence records and sets of biophysical and bioclimatic variables were inputted to Maxent program to predict current and future distribution of the species. The Maxent models of the threatened species were evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under Curve (ROC AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS) tests which revealed that the models generated were better than random. The Maxent models ROC AUC values of the 14 species range from 0.70 to 0.972 which is higher than 0.5 of a null model. Based on TSS criteria, Maxent models performed good in two species, very good in ten species, and excellent in two species. Seven species (Afzelia rhomboidea; Koordersiodendron pinnatum; Mangifera altissima; Shorea contorta; Shorea palosapis; Shorea polysperma; Vitex parviflora) were found to likely benefit from future climate due to the potential increase in their suitable habitat while the other seven species (Agathis philippinensis; Celtis luzonica; Dipterocarpus grandiflorus; Shorea guiso; Shorea negrosensis; Toona calantas; Vatica mangachapoi) will likely experience decline in their suitable habitat. This study provided an initial understanding on how the distribution of threatened forest trees will be affected by climate change in the Philippines.

Community types were generally divided into two groups at the order level: woody communities in the forest landscapes and in the anthropogenic (agricultural and residential) landscapes. Tectona hamiltoniana and Terminalia oliveri were abundant in the forest landscapes, whereas Prosopis juliflora and Borassus flabellifer were common in the anthropogenic landscapes. Acacia catechu and Waltheria indica were distributed in communities with intermediate characteristics between the forest and anthropogenic landscapes. Communities in the anthropogenic landscapes lacked species from the forest landscapes. Forest landscape communities were endemic to Myanmar's dry zone, and T. hamiltoniana was dominant. A novel community of alien P. juliflora which is common to the world's dry forests, was detected in the anthropogenic landscapes. We predicted the distribution of dry forest communities across the study area using a logistic regression model based on landscape types and mesoscale environmental variables. Landscape was the most significant factor that explained the distribution of the communities, followed by elevation. The forest landscape communities, especially the Shorea siamensis- T. hamiltoniana and T. hamiltoniana- T. oliveri forest alliances were rare in the study area. The limited area of these communities suggested their importance for conservation planning.},

It is of great importance to ensure its sustainable production and genetic resource protection under climate change. In this study, niche models built with climate and soil variables, respectively, were used to assess the impact of climate change on its potential suitable habitat. The model performance was excellent for the climate model (AUC = 0.92) and good for the soil model (AUC = 0.84). Three climate variables (degree-days below zero, mean coldest month temperature, and mean annual precipitation) and two soil variables (subsoil cation exchange capacity and topsoil cation exchange capacity) were the main factors determining the distribution of ginkgo fruit forests. The level of predicted habitat suitability was consistent with the differences observed in fruit traits, suggesting that our model predictions make biological and economic sense. The high- and medium-suitable habitats of this species would decrease in future climates under both the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios. This study contributed to a better understanding of the impact of climate change on ginkgo fruit forests and provided potential geographical areas for the cultivation and conservation of this species.},

Ecological niche-based models are widely used to map habitat suitability of current and future potential distribution of species, using precise coordinates of species occurrences, along with climatic and various environmental variables. Despite the importance of high dependence on forest resources in the Himalayan region, the direct impacts of climate change on major forest tree species is not well-documented. In the present study, we used MaxEnt (or maximum entropy) modelling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of four ecologically and economically dominant forest tree species (Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda, and Pinus roxburghii) in the central Himalayan region. Future predictions were based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for two time periods (2050s and 2070s). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt by combining different climatic, geomorphologic, and pedologic variables as predictor variables to model the potential climatic niches. We evaluated the model performance with an average AUC value varying as 0.809 (±0.020), 0.982 (±0.008), 0.966 (±0.006), and 0.803 (±0.025) for Q. leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda and P. roxburghii, respectively. Depending upon the RCPs, the results show both increase and decrease in suitable habitat range of these species across all future climate scenarios. The shifts in geographic distributions of climatic niches show unusual patterns, implying the need for urgent adaptive forest management strategies. Our approach can be used as a baseline database for broad-scale applicability in forest tree species restoration and conservation planning.},

The rare and endangered plants are important biodiversity elements. However, the lack of comprehensive and reliable information on the spatial distribution of these organisms has hampered holistic and efficient conservation management measures. We explored the consequences of climate change on the geographical distribution of Firmiana kwangsiensis (Malvaceae), an endangered species, to provide a reference for conservation, introduction, and cultivation of this species in new ecological zones. Modeling of the potential distribution of F. kwangsiensis under the current and two future climate scenarios in maximum entropy was performed based on 30 occurrence records and 27 environmental variables of the plant. We found that precipitation-associated and temperature-associated variables limited the potentially suitable habitats for F. kwangsiensis. Our model predicted 259,504 km2 of F. kwangsiensis habitat based on 25 percentile thresholds. However, the high suitable habitat for F. kwangsiensis is only about 41,027 km2. F. kwangsiensis is most distributed in Guangxi's protected areas. However, the existing reserves are only 2.7% of the total suitable habitat and 4.2% of the high suitable habitat for the plant, lower than the average protection area in Guangxi (7.2%). This means the current protected areas network is insufficient, underlining the need for alternative conservation mechanisms to protect the plant habitat. Our findings will help identify additional F. kwangsiensis localities and potential habitats and inform the development and implementation of conservation, management, and cultivation practices of such rare tree species.},

Thus, it is imperative to conserve the diversity of Sapindus. This study aimed to reveal the potential habitat distribution patterns of Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak in response to the current environment and future climate change. Furthermore, we aimed to identify hotspots of habitat degradation/expansion to facilitate climate change-adaptive biological conservation. Using current environmental data and future climate projections (2021–2100), we simulated the present and potential future habitats of Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model that was developed based on 2041 occurrence records. The model showed that precipitation may play an important role in framing the potential habitats of Sapindus. Notably, S. delavayi was more sensitive to minimum temperatures (−4 °C to 5.5 °C), soil moisture (82–132 mm), and elevation (1200–3200 m), whereas S. rarak was the most sensitive to isothermality (50–86) and soil moisture (54–126). Under the current environment, Sapindus mukorossi had the widest suitable habitat distribution (252.50 × 104 km2), followed by that of Sapindus rarak (215.62 × 104 km2) and Sapindus delavayi (90.86 × 104 km2). Under future climate change scenarios, the habitat distribution of Sapindus mukorossi was predicted to expand at higher latitudes and extensively contract at lower latitudes. Moreover, the projected suitable habitat distribution of S. delavayi showed inconspicuous expansion and contraction, whereas that S. rarak underwent conspicuous contraction and expansion. Moreover, there were distinct ecological habits among Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak in the east and southeast Asia. Thus, it is recommended that the contraction areas should be preferentially subjected to germplasm collection and conservation. Based on these findings, we propose preserved areas as the base for future Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak conservation, breeding, cultivation, and utilisation.},

However, geographically divergent tree populations are expected to respond differently to climate change. Considering intraspecific local adaptation in modeling species responses to climate change will thus improve the credibility and usefulness of climate niche models, particularly for genetic resources management. In this study, we used five Platycladus orientalis (L.) seed zones (Northwestern; Northern; Central; Southern; and Subtropical) covering the entire species range in China. A climate niche model was developed and used to project the suitable climatic conditions for each of the five seed zones for current and various future climate scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Our results indicated that the Subtropical seed zone would show consistent reduction for all climate change scenarios. The remaining seed zones, however, would experience various degrees of expansion in suitable habitat relative to their current geographic distributions. Most of the seed zones would gain suitable habitats at their northern distribution margins and higher latitudes. Thus, we recommend adjusting the current forest management strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.},

Teak (Tectona grandis) is one of the most valuable tropical hardwood species in the international timber market, and natural teak forests are distributed from India through Myanmar, Laos and Thailand. The extents of teak forests are shrinking due to deforestation and the local impacts of global climate change. However, the direct impacts of climate changes on the continental-scale distributions of native and non-native teak have not been examined. In this study, we developed a species distribution model for teak across its entire native distribution in tropical Asia, and its non-native distribution in Bangladesh. We used presence-only records of trees and twelve environmental variables that were most representative for current teak distributions in South and Southeast Asia. MaxEnt (maximum entropy) models were used to model the distributions of teak under current and future climate scenarios. We found that land use/land cover change and elevation were the two most important variables explaining the current and future distributions of native and non-native teak in tropical Asia. Changes in annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality and annual mean actual evapotranspiration may result in shifts in the distributions of teak across tropical Asia. We discuss the implications for the conservation of critical teak habitats, forest management planning, and risks of biological invasion that may occur due to its cultivation in non-native ranges.},

In this study, the ecological niche model (ENM) MaxEnt was used to evaluate habitat suitability and predict potential habitats of two sympatric fig species, i.e., Ficus squamosa and F. heterostyla, in the Xishuangbanna region of China. Results indicated that mean diurnal range, isothermality, cation exchange capacity (at pH 7), and temperature seasonality were key variables influencing habitat suitability for F. squamosa. However, temperature seasonality and precipitation of the driest quarter showed the greatest contributions to F. heterostyla distribution. During the current period, the habitat suitability distributions of both Ficus species were considerably higher than known occurrences. In the future, potentially suitable distribution areas for both species will reduce overall across the whole study area, although some expansion may occur by 2070. Niche overlap of suitable areas for both species was initially high and then declined in the current period and future epochs in the RCP 2.6 scenario, but increased in the RCP 8.5 scenario. In short, the responses of both Ficus species to climate change differed. Thus, specific actions such as ex situ conservation and assisted migration may be needed to conserve both species.},

It is cultivated mostly in the warm temperate Mediterranean coastal region, and in the tropical and subtropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It also grows naturally in northeast India, Myanmar, and Yunnan (China). Citron populations are declining in their natural habitats due to forest degradation and change in land use patterns. To predict the habitat suitability for citron, we evaluated four widely used species distribution models (SDMs), namely Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) in ‘sdm’ package. Based on Area under ROC Curve (AUC; >0.97) and True Skill Statistics (TSS; >0.9) of all four models, an ensemble modeling was carried out using 111 geo-referenced datasets and 19 bioclimatic and three topographic variables under three climate change scenarios (current, 2050 and 2070). Precipitation of warmest quarter (bio18, 69.6%), elevation (11.1%), mean temperature of wettest quarter (bio8, 10.6%), and temperature seasonality (bio4, 10.1%) were the most important environmental variables for determining the distribution of citron in the study area. Potentially suitable habitat for citron was predicted to occur from 12 – 29 °N to 79 – 108 °E. The total suitable habitat covers about 875,868 km2, including 195,846 km2, 274,386 km2, and 405,636 km2, representing high, moderate, and least suitable areas, respectively. Increase in habitat suitability was predicted for 2050 and 2070 under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs), i. e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5. This study predicted that northeast India and northern Myanmar would remain moderately or highly suitable for citron.},

Our modeling results show that for the current potential distribution of M. cajuputi species, only 10.82% (1346.5 km2) of Terengganu area is suitable habitat, which 0.96% of the areas are under high, 2.44% moderate and 7.42% poor habitat suitability.

From the future habitat suitability projection, we found that the habitat suitability in Marang would degrade significantly under all climate scenarios, while in Setiu the habitat suitability for M. cajuputi remains stable throughout the climate change scenarios. The modeling prediction shows a significant influence on the soil properties, temperature, and precipitation during monsoon months. These results could benefit conservationist and policymakers for decision making.

In addition, we (2) estimated the total large habitat patches (> 40 km2) for each species, and determine how it change in the future. We also (3) investigated large habitat patches change within PAs. Moreover, we (4) evaluated the Phasianidae diversity hotspots in the current and future predictions. The results showed climate change is likely to reduce the suitable natural habitats in Southeast Asia, with an average reduction of habitat patches was 180,970 km2 (11%) when comparing the future predictions with the current state. Most of the species appeared to be retreating to higher altitudes and face suitable habitat reduction by 2100. The large habitat patch average declined 183,474 km2 (12%), with 2–10 species in imminent danger of losing their habitat (depending on the climate change modeling scenarios). The current large patches in the protected areas represented a small proportion of the total large patch distribution, and there were fewer future large patches than currently available. The species risk a reduction in diversity, especially in the Indo-Burma region where most of them are facing a massive loss of their suitable habitats. We suggest the use of Phasianidae as indicator species to monitor natural forests in Southeast Asia and the implementation of adaptive conservation management to prevent further losses in the future.},

The main purpose of this study was to map and predict the current and future potential suitable habitats of these two species using MaxEnt based on the presence location of species and environmental variables.

X. sorbifolium was mainly distributed in Inner Mongolia Plateau and Loess Plateau with an area of 146.15 × 104 km2 .

Location: Taiwan. Methods: A data set of 9822 vegetation plots with environmental characteristics recorded in the field or derived from digital maps in GIS was compiled from historical literature and an extensive field survey. Using expert knowledge, 6574 of these plots were used to build a classification into broad vegetation types. The units of the resulting classification were formally defined using a Cocktail determination key, which can be used for the automatic assignment of new vegetation plots to these vegetation types. Results: Twelve vegetation types of zonal forests and nine types of azonal forests were distinguished. Zonal types in the subtropical region, from high mountains to foothills, are Juniperus subalpine coniferous woodland, Abies-Tsuga upper-montane coniferous forest, Chamaecyparis montane mixed cloud forest, Fagus montane deciduous broad-leaved cloud forest, Quercus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest, Machilus-Castanopsis sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, Phoebe-Machilus sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest and Ficus-Machilus semi-evergreen foothill forest. Zonal types in the tropical region, from high mountains to foothills, are Pasania-Elaeocarpus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest, Drypetes-Helicia sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, Dysoxylum-Machilus foothill evergreen broad-leaved forest and Aglaia-Ficus foothill evergreen broad-leaved forest. Azonal types are Illicium-Cyclobalanopsis tropical winter monsoon forest, Pyrenaria-Machilus subtropical winter monsoon forest, Diospyros-Champereia tropical rock-outcrop forest, Zelkova-Quercus subtropical rock-outcrop forest, Pinus successional woodland, Alnus successional woodland, Trema-Mallotus successional woodland, Scaevola-Hibiscus seashore woodland and Kandelia mangrove. Conclusions: The diversity of forest vegetation in Taiwan is strongly structured by the temperature and moisture gradient. Along the temperature gradient, five altitudinal zones can be recognized. Azonal forest types develop at sites affected by the winter monsoon, on steep slopes, rocky soils, in seashore saline habitats and in places disturbed by fire, landslides and human activities. Zonal vegetation contains a higher ratio of endemic and Pacific species and occurs in wetter habitats, whereas azonal vegetation contains co-existing species from different regions and usually occurs in drier habitats. © 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

   abstract = {Owing to the influence of the Tibeto-Himalayan Highland, the east-and southeast-coastal zone of the Asian continent lacks the subtropical dry belt, which elsewhere in the world separates temperate forest areas from the humid tropics. Thus forest climates with sufficient rainfall cover coastal areas of the Western Pacific from subarctic eastern Siberia to equatorial SE Asia, giving rise to a sequence of five forest formations. The warm-temperate evergreen (lucidophyll) forest formation is peculiar to this region and represents the east-coast counterpart of Mediterranean sclerophyll forest, which develops under the west-coast climate with a different pattern of seasonal rainfall distribution. The characteristics of the five formations and their latitudinal distribution were briefly described as being related to climatic environments. Certain ecosystem properties such as floristic diversity and the rate of organic matter decomposition were found to be very sensitive to thermal gradients, whereas the responses of plant biomass, primary productivity, etc. to changes in thermal climate were less apparent.},

   abstract = {The complexity of natural conditions leads to the complexity of vegetation types of Taiwan of China, which has both tropical and cold-temperate vegetation types, and could be depicted as the vegetation miniature of China or even for the world. The physiognomic-floristic principle was adopted for the vegetation classification of Taiwan. The units of rank from top to bottom are: class of vegetation-type, order of vegetation-type, vegetation-type, alliance group, alliance and association. The high-rank units (class , order and vegetation-type) are classified by ecological physiognomy, while the median and lower units by the species composition of community. At the same time the role of dominant species and character species will also be considered. The dominant species are the major factor concerned with the median ranks (alliance group, and alliance) because they are the chief components of community, additionally their remarkable appearance is easy to identify; the character species (or diagnostic species) are for relatively low ranks (association) because they will clearly show the interspecies relationship and the characteristics of community. According to this principle, vegetation of Taiwan is classified into five classes of vegetation-type~ (forests, thickets, herbaceous vegetation, rock fields vegetation, swamps and aquatic vegetation) , 29 orders of vegetation-types (cold-temperate needle-leaved forests, cool-temperate needle-leaved forests, warm-temperate needle-leaved forests, warm needle-leaved forests, deciduous broad-leaved forests, mixed evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forests, evergreen mossy forests, evergreen sclerophyllous forests, evergreen broad-leaved forests, tropical rain forests, tropical monsoon forests, coastal forests, warm bamboo forests, evergreen needle-leaved thickets, sclerophyllous thickets, deciduous broad-leaved thickets, evergreen broad-leaved thickets, xerothermic thorn-succulent thickets, bamboo thickets, meadows, sparse shrub grasslands, savannahic grasslands, sparse scree communities, chasmophytic vegetation, woody swamps, herbaceous swamps, moss bogs, fresh water aquatic vegetation, salt water aquatic vegetation) and 53 vegetation-types. The main alliances of each vegetation-type are described.},

   abstract = {The maintenance of species boundaries despite interspecific gene flow has been a continuous source of interest in evolutionary biology. Many hybridizing species have porous genomes with regions impermeable to introgression, conferring reproductive barriers between species. We used ecological niche modelling to study the glacial and postglacial recolonization patterns between the widely hybridizing spruce species Picea glauca and P. engelmannii in western North America. Genome-wide estimates of admixture based on a panel of 311 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 290 genes were used to assess levels of admixture and introgression and to identify loci putatively involved in adaptive differences or reproductive barriers between species. Our palaeoclimatic modelling suggests that these two closely related species have a long history of hybridization and introgression, dating to at least 21 000 years ago, yet species integrity is maintained by a combination of strong environmental selection and reduced current interspecific gene flow. Twenty loci showed evidence of divergent selection, including six loci that were both Fst outliers and associated with climatic gradients, and fourteen loci that were either outliers or showed associations with climate. These included genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction and transcription factors. © 2014 The Authors. Molecular Ecology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

   abstract = {The niche concept is central to ecology but is often depicted descriptively through observing associations between organisms and habitats. Here, we argue for the importance of mechanistically modelling niches based on functional traits of organisms and explore the possibilities for achieving this through the integration of three theoretical frameworks: Biophysical ecology (BE), the geometric framework for nutrition (GF) and dynamic energy budget (DEB) models. These three frameworks are fundamentally based on the conservation laws of thermodynamics, describing energy and mass balance at the level of the individual and capturing the prodigious predictive power of the concepts of 'homeostasis' and 'evolutionary fitness'. BE and the GF provide mechanistic multi-dimensional depictions of climatic and nutritional niches, respectively, providing a foundation for linking organismal traits (morphology, physiology, behaviour) with habitat characteristics. In turn, they provide driving inputs and cost functions for mass/energy allocation within the individual as determined by DEB models.We show how integration of the three frameworks permits calculation of activity constraints, vital rates (survival, development, growth, reproduction) and ultimately population growth rates and species distributions. When integrated with contemporary niche theory, functional trait niche models hold great promise for tackling major questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

In the face of a changing climate, management requires projections of changes in the distribution of the climatic niche of the major species and strategies for applying the projections. We prepared climatic habitat models incorporating heatload as a topographic predictor for the 14 upland tree species of southwestern Colorado, USA, an area that has already seen substantial climate impacts. Models were trained with over 800,000 points of known presence and absence. Using 11 climate scenarios for the decade around 2060, we classified and mapped change for each species. Projected impacts are extensive. Except for the low-elevation woodland species, persistent habitat is rare. Most habitat is lost or threatened and is poorly compensated by emergent habitat. Three species may be locally extirpated. Nevertheless, strategies are described that can use the projections to apply management where it is likely to be most effective, to facilitate or assist migration, to favor species likely to be suited in the future, and to identify potential climate refugia.},

Dry deposition of NH3 contributed 34.2 ± 57.9 μg N m-2 hr-1; whereas HNO3 contributed slightly larger dry deposition of nitrogen, 35.2 ± 16.0 μg N m -2 hr-1, in NC. NH4+ and NO 3 hourly-averaged wet deposition fluxes were calculated as 37.3 ± 19.7 μg N m-2 hr-1 and 40.6 ± 11.8 μg N m-2 hr-1, respectively.

Here we evaluate whether the spatial autocorrelation underlying species data affects accuracy-statistics and map the uncertainties due to spatial autocorrelation effects on species range predictions under past and future climate models. As an example, ENMs were fitted to Qualea grandiflora (Vochysiaceae), a widely distributed plant from Brazilian Cerrado. We corrected for spatial autocorrelation in ENMs by selecting sampling sites equidistant in geographical (GEO) and environmental (ENV) spaces. Distributions were modelled using 13 ENMs evaluated by two accuracy-statistics (TSS and AUC), which were compared with uncorrected ENMs. Null models and the similarity statistics I were used to evaluate the effects of spatial autocorrelation. Moreover, we applied a hierarchical ANOVA to partition and map the uncertainties from the time (across last glacial maximum, pre-insustrial, and 2080 time periods) and methodological components (ENMs and autocorrelation corrections). The GEO and ENV models had the highest accuracy-statistics values, although only the ENV model had values higher than expected by chance alone for most of the 13 ENMs. Uncertainties from time component were higher in the core region of the Brazilian Cerrado where Q. grandiflora occurs, whereas methodological components presented higher uncertainties in the extreme northern and southern regions of South America (i.e. outside of Brazilian Cerrado). Our findings show that accounting for autocorrelation in environmental space is more efficient than doing so in geographical space. Methodological uncertainties were concentrated in outside the core region of Q. grandiflora's habitat. Conversely, uncertainty due to time component in the Brazilian Cerrado reveals that ENMs were able to capture climate change effects on Q. grandiflora distributions. © 2014 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Selecting tree species to plant for forest ecosystem restoration is critical but problematic. Knowing tree species’ climatic niches can help, but such information is limited for most tropical tree species. Consequently, the research presented here explored the use of climate and species record location data, to map the potential distribution of four tree species across tropical and subtropical Asia based on their modelled climatic niches. All were framework species, of proven effectiveness for forest restoration: Choerospondias axillaris (Roxb.) B.L. Burtt and A.W. Hill, Ficus hispida L.f., Hovenia dulcis Thunb., and Prunus cerasoides Buch.-Ham. ex D. Don. Potential species distributions were projected onto maps of known climatic conditions using the maximum entropy algorithm in Maxent software to predict where the climate is conducive for including each species in forest restoration trials. The models predicted species location very well for F. hispida and H. dulcis and fairly well for P. cerasoides and C. axillaris. Climatically suitable areas for C. axillaris were located mostly north of the equator, whilst those of F. hispida, H. dulcis and P. cerasoides extended south of the equator. The importance of each climatic niche variable differed among species. Driest-month precipitation was critical for F. hispida, as well as mean dry-season temperature for C. axillaris and P. cerasoides and cold-season precipitation for H. dulcis. In addition to aiding species selection for forest restoration, potential distribution maps based on climatic niche models can indicate where novel species for tree plantations might be successful and where species might become invasive. Applying such techniques to a large number of species will be needed to significantly improve species selection for forest ecosystem restoration.},

Predictive models using various climatic and topographical factors influencing Brown oak's growth and survival were developed to define its current ecological niche. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method involving Saaty's pair-wise comparison was performed to rank the explanatory powers of each compared variable. Variables were suitably weighted using fuzzy factor standardization scheme to reflect their relative importance in defining species niche. An optimum indicator was then chosen for deriving a site suitability map of brown oak. This study establishes the role of aspect in the current distribution of the species along with known influence of altitude. Future niches of oak has been tracked in the projected climate change scenario of +1 o C and +2 o C rise in temperature and 20 mm in precipitation.

Productivity was defined as the volume of wood expected per hectare at age 20 and was calculated as the product of predicted individual tree volumes, an initial stocking (1600 trees ha −1), and predicted survival. Impact was considered according to the transient effects of a changing climate governed by (1) physiological plasticity in the contemporary generation and (2) long-term evolutionary adjustments that provide adaptedness and optimize productivity in future generations. Direct short-term plastic responses were geographically complex and had repercussions throughout the species' distribution even when temperature fluctuations were small (±1 • C) and changes in distribution were inconsequential. Evolutionary adjustments ameliorated negative short-term impacts while enhancing the positive. Scenarios that encompassed predictions for global warming produced short-term impacts that were negative in the south and positive in the north, but subsequent evolutionary adjustments projected substantial increases in productivity. The long-term adjustments may require only 1 to 3 generations in the north but 6 to 12 generations in the south, thereby taking between 200 and 1200 years.},

   abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs), which statistically relate species occurrence to climqtic variables, are widely used to identify areas suitable for species growth under future climates and to plan for assisted migration. When SDMs are projected qcross times or spaces, it is assumed that species climatic requirements remain constant. However, empirical evidence supporting this assumption is rare, and SDM predictions could be biased. Historical human-aided movements of tree species can shed light on the reliability of SDM predictions in planning for assisted migration. We used Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), a North American conifer introduced into Europe during the mid-19th century, as a case-study to test niche conservatism. We combined transcontinental data sets of Douglas-fir occurrence and climatic predictors to compare the realized niches between native and introduced ranges. We calibrated a SDM in the native range and compared areas predicted to be climatically suitable with observed presences. The realized niches in the native and introduced ranges showed very limited overlap. The SDM calibrated in North America had very high predictive power in the native range, but failed to predict climatic suitability in Europe where Douglas-fir grows in climates that have no analogue in the native range. We review the ecological mechanisms and silvicultural practices that can trigger such shifts in realized niches. Retrospective analysis of tree species introduction revealed that the assumption of niche conservatism is erroneous. As a result, distributions predicted by SDM are importantly biased. There is a high risk that assisted migration programs may be misdirected and target inadequate species or introduction zones.},

The biological transformation of exudates into microbial metabolites and necromass is a major source of soil organic matter (SOM), including persistent mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). Recent recognition of the fundamental importance of these inputs from living roots for sustaining life belowground and replenishing SOM demands a rethinking of how we harvest forests. By severing the lifeline of living roots, clearcut harvesting devastates much of the belowground biodiversity in forests, and prohibits a principal pathway through which SOM and C stocks are replenished. Retention harvesting retains the influence of living roots within retention patches and potentially throughout the harvested area, but only if inter-tree distances are 15 m or less. Retention trees sustain and support the re-establishment of belowground life and function following forest harvest and may mitigate post-harvest soil C losses. Sustaining the belowground ecosystem via inputs from living roots is an underappreciated benefit of continuous-cover and retention forestry.},

The studies include: (a) forest ecosystem services; (b) forests and water; (c) forests and energy; and (d) the sustainable consumption and production of forest products. Executive Summary The world's forest ecosystems provide critical and diverse services and values to human society. As primary habitat for a wide range of species, forests support biodiversity maintenance and conservation. Forest growth sequesters and stores carbon from the atmosphere, contributing to regulation of the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Healthy forest ecosystems produce and conserve soil and stabilize stream flows and water runoff-preventing land degradation and desertification, and reducing the risks of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and landslides. Forests also serve as sites of aesthetic, recreational, and spiritual value in many cultural and societal contexts, and contribute to poverty eradication and economic development by providing food, fiber, timber, and other forest products for subsistence and income generation.},

Results demonstrate more commonalities than differences between the two groups; they both expressed a personal-often spiritual-connection with nature and both value long-term and interdisciplinary management strategies. First Nation individuals have a unique spiritual relationship with western redcedar that is linked to both everyday and ceremonial practices, while ecologically-based foresters and ecologists have personal and academic relationships broadly with nature. They have similar environmental concerns of damage from industrial forestry practices, particularly the loss of old growth forests, and the negative effects of climate change. Our results support the assertion that First Nation perspectives are equally scholarly as the foresters' perspectives are reverential, and people from varied cultural backgrounds can care for the environment in similar ways. Moreover, an interdisciplinary approach that unifies science with Indigenous teachings can encourage a new moral framework for forestry management that values resources beyond commodification.},

This small-scale study provides baseline information on the characteristics of Canadian Forest Schools, the challenges that educators face in starting up these outdoor programs, and the potential benefits for enrolled children. An online survey study was conducted in the fall of 2017, to which 25 Forest School educators from across Canada responded. Results suggest that Canadian Forest School programs vary in terms of size, age of the children, type of outdoor setting, funding source, and schedule. Participants reported facing challenges such as finding an appropriate outdoor site, safety concerns related to outdoor activities, and the lack of support from different stakeholders. Many of these barriers were surmounted by developing relationships with local partners, adapting programs to comply with local regulations, and educating the community on Forest School pedagogy. In line with the growing international body of research on the benefits of Forest School (e.g., Elliott & Chancellor, 2014; Müller et al., 2017; Murray & O’Brien, 2005; Slade, Lowery & Bland, 2013), Canadian Forest School educators have observed benefits for the children, including the development of their social and physical skills and self-confidence, increased appreciation for nature, and enhanced creativity. Further research is needed to fully capture and examine this growing practice in the Canadian context.},

The findings revealed that an increase in maximum temperature has decreased lac (Kerria lacca) yield significantly by 31.60 tonnes/year. Changing climate has degraded the quality of NTFPs which has direct impacts on NTFP-based livelihoods, with the sale price of lac falling from 350 to 150 INR/kg, mahua from 22 to 20 INR/kg, and tamarind from 22 to 18 INR/kg in recent years. The majority of respondents believed that infrastructure development (98.7%), forest cover loss (94.83%) had caused shifts in climatic trends. 22% of the respondents believed that not taking into account their indigenous understanding of climate change in institutional processes was one of the challenges they face for adaptation and coping mechanisms.

   abstract = {Recent studies have assessed the ecological effects of climate change on boreal forests; however, our understanding of the economic impacts of climate change on timber supply remains limited. Forestry is an important boreal industry; hence, it is necessary to better understand the ecological impacts that directly and indirectly affect this sector. We reviewed published literature concerning ecological impacts of climate change on biome shifts, regional forest disturbances, and tree growth, mortality and species compositional shifts in established forest stands. Subsequently, we examined how each factor influences timber supply and forestry. Tree species ranges have been and will continue migrating north to find more suitable growing conditions, but at a slower rate than climate change. Biome shifts from forests to shrub or grasslands may occur under persistent drought conditions. Warmer temperatures and lower climate moisture availability increase forest disturbances; notably fire and insect outbreaks, creating younger forests dominated by pioneer species and limiting harvestable material. While tree growth and mortality rates are spatially variable across established forest regions, tree mortality has temporally increased with climate change; accompanied by reduced growth or increased growth at a rate lower than mortality loss, resulting in a reduced rate of volume accumulation and timber available for harvest. Moreover, climate change favors pioneer species (Pinus spp. and Populus spp.) over late successional species (Picea spp. and Abies spp.). Our findings suggest that climate change has strong negative effects on boreal timber supply but may prompt operational adaptations, opening opportunities for forest industry to incorporate species such as Populus.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The objective of the present study was to evaluate soil microbial community function and diversity among eight single and mixed species forest ecosystems (18-year-old restoration) in subtropical China. Materials and methods: Soil samples of the 0-10 cm depth were taken from each of the eight forest ecosystems: Masson pine (CP1); Pitch pine (CP2); Slash pine and Sweetgum (CBMP1); Slash pine and Camphortree (CBMP2); Masson pine and Sweetgum and Chinese Gugertree (CBMP3); Sweetgum and Chinese Gugertree (BMP); Chinese Gugertree (BP1); and Sweetgum (BP2). Potential soil bacterial catabolic activities were assessed by the MicroResp™, and bacterial and fungal community diversities were analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique. Results and discussion: Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) rates and catabolic evenness of the SIR values for 15 carbon (C) sources under the broadleaved forest ecosystems (BP2, BMP, BP1) were much higher than those under the mixed conifer-broadleaved forest ecosystem (CBMP1 and CBMP2), and then under the pure conifer forest ecosystems (CP2 and CP1). Value of Shannon-Weaver index in the MicroResp™ was similar to that in the DGGE method, but the value of evenness was lower than that in the DGGE method. Principal component analysis, using all 15 C sources in the MicroResp™, 39 bands of fungi and 21 main bands of bacteria in the DGGE profiles, revealed a separation of all the soil samples, indicating that they had different patterns of potential C utilization and different microbial communities. The scores of the first principal component appeared to reflect the variation of soil microbial functional and structural communities associated with different forest ecosystems. Conclusions: Results from this study showed that forest ecosystems have significantly influenced the composition and function of soil microbial community. Catabolic diversity and function of soil microbial community under broadleaf tree species and mixed broadleaf-conifer plant species are much better than under conifer tree species. This may indicate that the efficiency of soil quality restoration is higher under broadleaf species than under coniferous species. Further study is needed for investigating the consequences of the changes seen in this study on soil microbial functional diversity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Here we tease apart the effects of biotic and abiotic factors, both above-and belowground, on EMF on the Tibetan Plateau, China. We found that a suite of biotic and abiotic variables account for up to 86% of the variation in EMF, with the combined effects of above-and belowground biodiversity accounting for 45% of the variation in EMF. Our results have two important implications: first, including belowground biodiversity in models can improve the ability to explain and predict EMF. Second, regional-scale variation in climate, and perhaps climate change, can determine, or at least modify, the effects of biodiversity on EMF in natural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Mesoamerica, Chocó and the tropical Andes are recognized as biodiversity hotspots where conservation action is urgently needed. Because World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) ecoregions are commonly used as the basis for conservation decisions, an understanding of WWF ecoregions environmental heterogeneity and their representation in current protected areas (PAs) is important for identifying priority areas for conservation. Thirteen environmental domain classifications based on 22 climatic and topographical variables and the Shannon diversity index were used to quantify environmental diversity for each WWF ecoregion. The area of each environmental domain and ecoregion was compared with the World Database on Protected Areas 2007. The most environmentally-diverse ecoregions were poorly represented in the PAs and several ecoregions showed low environmental heterogeneity representation inside PAs, for example the Balsas depression, Sierra Madre del Sur and the Chiapas Sierras in Mexico, some sierras in Central America, the Middle Magdalena, inter-Andean valleys, the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia and the Western Moist Forest of Ecuador. Using WWF ecoregions as equivalent units for conservation and management can be misleading, given their environmental heterogeneity; therefore, they have limited usefulness in assessing environmental representation in PAs. An underestimation of environmental heterogeneity representation in PAs can have misleading implications for conservation actions in regions where detailed biological information is lacking. Conservation efforts should focus on the environmental domains and ecoregions showing high environmental heterogeneity that is poorly represented in PAs.

   abstract = {The concept of an ecoregion, a discrete spatial area where species composition is presumed to be relatively homogeneous compared to that between areas, has become an increasingly common conservation tool. We test the effectiveness of one ecoregion delineation (World Wildlife Fund) in capturing patterns of change in species composition of birds, mammals, and trees across the United States (excluding Hawaii) and Canada, and describe the extent to which each ecoregion boundary is concurrent with relatively large changes in species composition. Digitized range maps were used to record presence/absence in 50 × 50 km equal-area grid cells covering the study area. Jaccard's index of similarity was calculated for all pairs of cells in the same or adjacent ecoregions. The average rate at which similarity declined with geographic distance was calculated using pairs of cells within the same ecoregion (intra-ecoregion turnover) or using pairs of cells in adjacent ecoregions (inter-ecoregion turnover). The intra-ecoregion rate varies widely among ecoregions and between taxa, with trees having a faster rate of similarity decline than mammals or birds. For all three species groups, most ecoregion boundaries have similar rates across them (inter-ecoregion) than that within each adjacent ecoregion (intra-ecoregion), with the exception of zones of transition between biomes and major geographical features. Although the ecoregion concept is useful for many other conservation applications, the lack of systematic, high turnover rates along ecoregion boundaries suggests that ecoregions should not be used as a quantitative basis for delineating geographic areas of a particular taxonomic group. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impacts of future climate change in shifted means and extremes of temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover under the representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) on the characteristics of these ecoregions have yet to be fully understood. The present study was designed using a dynamic global vegetation model and both current and future climate scenarios, to investigate the impacts of shifted means and extremes of temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover on five ecological indicators including net primary productivity (NPP), carbon storage, runoff, wildfire risk, and habitat transformation at the ecoregional scale. The analysis was performed for the terrestrial ecoregions as a whole, as well as for specific subsets of CEs, VEs, and IEs. The results showed that future climate scenarios (whether RCP 2.6, 4.5, or 8.5) were estimated to increase the mean NPP, runoff, wildfire risk, and habitat transformation for all ecoregion types, when comparing values for 2071–2100 to the baseline (1971–2000) period. In contrast, the mean carbon storage in the TEWs, VEs, and CEs was estimated to decrease from the baseline to the values under RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 and then increase to their largest values under RCP 8.5. The mean carbon storage in the IEs under RCP 8.5 was estimated to remain lower than the baseline period values. Climate change in shifted means and extremes of temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover are generally significant drivers of the variances of NPP, carbon storage, runoff, wildfire risk, and habitat transformation under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5. The dynamics of the climate change metrics and the five ecological indicators have significant implications for biodiversity conservation in changing climates.},

   abstract = {Key recent developments in litter decomposition research are reviewed. Long-term inter-site experiments indicate that temperature and moisture influence early rates of litter decomposition primarily by determining the plants present, suggesting that climate change effects will be small unless they alter the plant forms present. Thresholds may exist at which single factors control decay rate. Litter decomposes faster where the litter type naturally occurs. Elevated CO2 concentrations have little effect on litter decomposition rates. Plant tissues are not decay-resistant; it is microbial and biochemical transformations of materials into novel recalcitrant compounds rather than selective preservation of recalcitrant compounds that creates stable organic matter. Altering single characteristics of litter will not substantially alter decomposition rates. Nitrogen addition frequently leads to greater stabilization into humus through a combination of chemical reactions and enzyme inhibition. To sequester more C in soil, we need to consider not how to slow decomposition, but rather how to divert more litter into humus through microbial and chemical reactions rather than allowing it to decompose. The optimal strategy is to have litter transformed into humic substances and then chemically or physically protected in mineral soil. Adding N through fertilization and N-fixing plants is a feasible means of stimulating humification. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

These environmental changes affect citizen's health, causing a high number of premature deaths, with considerable social and economic costs. Nature-based solutions are essential to ameliorate those impacts in urban areas. While the mere presence of urban green spaces is pointed as an overarching solution, the relative importance of specific vegetation structure, composition and management to improve the ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation are overlooked. This avoids the establishment of optimized planning and management procedures for urban green spaces with high spatial resolution and detail. Our aim was to understand the relative contribution of vegetation structure, composition and management for the provision of ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation in urban green spaces, in particular the case of urban parks. This work was done in a large urban park with different types of vegetation surrounded by urban areas. As indicators of microclimatic effects and of air pollution levels we selected different metrics: lichen diversity and pollutants accumulation in lichens. Among lichen diversity, functional traits related to nutrient and water requirements were used as surrogates of the capacity of vegetation to filter air pollution and to regulate climate, and provide air purification and climate regulation ecosystem services, respectively. This was also obtained with very high spatial resolution which allows detailed spatial planning for optimization of ecosystem services. We found that vegetation type characterized by a more complex structure (trees, shrubs and herbaceous layers) and by the absence of management (pruning, irrigation and fertilization) had a higher capacity to provide the ecosystems services of air purification and climate regulation. By contrast, lawns, which have a less complex structure and are highly managed, were associated to a lower capacity to provide these services. Tree plantations showed an intermediate effect between the other two types of vegetation. Thus, vegetation structure, composition and management are important to optimize green spaces capacity to purify air and regulate climate. Taking this into account green spaces can be managed at high spatial resolutions to optimize these ecosystem services in urban areas and contribute to improve human well-being.},

I introduce a simulation model called NICHE that embodies many of Hutchinson's original niche concepts and use this model to predict patterns of species distribution. The model may help to clarify how dispersal, niche size and competition interact, and under what conditions species might be common in unsuitable habitat or absent from suitable habitat. A brief review of the pertinent literature suggests that species are often absent from suitable habitat and present in unsuitable habitat, in ways predicted by theory. However, most tests of niche theory are hampered by inadequate consideration of what does and does not constitute suitable habitat. More conclusive evidence for these predictions will require rigorous determination of habitat suitability under field conditions. I suggest that to do this, ecologists must measure habitat specific demography and quantify how demographic parameters vary in response to temporal and spatial variation in measurable niche dimensions.},

   abstract = {Intensive agriculture can result in increased runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals that pollute streams. Consensus is emerging that, despite our best efforts, it is unlikely that significant reductions in nutrient loading to surface waters will be achieved through traditional, in-field management alone. Riparian forest buffers can play an important role in the movement of water and NPS (non-point source) pollutants to surface water bodies and ground water. Riparian buffers are linear in nature and because of their position in the landscape provide effective connections between the upland and aquatic ecosystems. Present designs tend to use one model with a zone of unmanaged trees nearest the stream followed by a zone of managed trees with a zone of grasses adjacent to the crop field. Numerous variations of that design using trees, shrubs, native grasses and forbs or nonnative cool-season grasses may provide better function for riparian forest buffers in specific settings. Properly designed riparian buffers have been shown to effectively reduce surface NPS pollutant movement to streams and under the right geological riparian setting can also remove them from the groundwater. Flexibility in design can also be used to produce various market and nonmarket goods. Design flexibility should become more widely practiced in the application of this agroforestry practice.},

   abstract = {Aim: This paper demonstrates methods to extend standardized vegetation zone descriptions and mapped distributions across political boundaries. An extended climate niche for North America's Coastal Douglas-fir (CDF) forest zone is determined and projected to evaluate its potential distribution under a changing climate and to identify climate refugia for conservation planning. Location: Pacific Northwest temperate rain forest in British Columbia (BC), CA, and nearby Washington (WA) and Oregon (OR), US. Methods: Using a combination of ecosystem polygon mapping and ecological plot data with climate interpolation tools, forests characterized as CDF under BC's biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification system were identified in the neighbouring US. Current (baseline) limits to CDF distribution were identified and used to map its potential distribution and climate refugia under future climate conditions using ensemble Global Climate Model projections. Results: The extended CDF climate niche covers 76 725 km2 under baseline conditions, with the majority of the area in the Pacific Northwest US. The extended CDF forest zone includes a vegetation assemblage consistent with existing definitions of BC's CDF moist maritime subzone, but also an additional vegetation assemblage representing a drier maritime subzone. Projections of future climate suggest a northerly shift (~150 km) and a decrease (-91.5%) in overall CDF area. Climate refugia are projected for discontinuous patches of CDF forest on Vancouver Island and adjacent mainland. Conclusions: This project combined georeferenced ecological plot data and digital maps, thereby facilitating the international mapping of ecosystem distributions in adjacent administrative areas that do not currently use the same ecosystem classification and mapping systems. This approach and the concept of climate niche definition, distribution and persistence are applicable to the management, restoration and conservation of plant communities, particularly in evaluating future ecosystem range shifts and disruptions associated with a changing climate. The potential for dramatic reductions in the range of the Coastal Douglas-fir zone, with persistence in <15% of its current area, suggest that most of the extended CDF zone is marginally suitable for the characteristic CDF ecosystems and that slight shifts in climate or disturbance regime may greatly alter the character of the vegetation. The full climatic niche for British Columbia's Coastal Douglas-fir forest zone is determined from its mapped distribution and georeferenced plot data in the neighbouring USA. A new subzone is characterized, and the potential distribution of the extended zone is projected under a changing climate to identify climate refugia. For sensitive ecosystems with multi-jurisdictional distributions, this approach helps focus conservation efforts.},

   abstract = {Cloud forest is a sensitive and vulnerable ecosystem that is threatened by human activities as well as climate change. Previous studies have shown how transitional ecosystems such as cloud forests will be the most negatively impacted by the global increase in temperature. Therefore, the niche modeling framework was used in this study to geographically identify the areas with the climatic potential to host the largest number of key tree species in this ecosystem and to propose them as priority conservation areas. A total of 19 species were modeled using the MaxEnt algorithm; binary maps were generated for each species and combined to produce one potential suitability map and identify climatic priority areas. Thus, 7% of the national area of Mexico shows suitability for the cloud forest ecosystem, although it is currently distributed in less than 1% of the country. Finally, potential suitability areas were compared with natural protected areas, current land use and priority conservation areas. We found that (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). i An update to this article is included at the end of the current suitable area, only 5% coincides with some federal or state protection regime. Natural protected areas have proven to be a mechanism for forest conservation, so we must consider increasing the number and area of those protected areas that favor the conservation of these key cloud forest species.},

   abstract = {We used Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) of individual species of two taxonomic groups (plants and birds) in order to reconstruct the climatic distribution of Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) in Mexico and to analyze their boundaries with other terrestrial ecosystems. The reconstruction for TDFs' distribution was analyzed considering the prediction and omission errors based upon the combination of species, obtained from the overlap of individual models (only plants, only birds, and all species combined). Two verifications were used: a primary vegetation map and 100 independent TDFs localities. We performed a Principal Component (PCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) to evaluate the variation in the environmental variables and ecological overlap among ecosystems. The modeling strategies showed differences in the ecological patterns and prediction areas, where the "all species combined" model (with a threshold of ≥10 species) was the best strategy to use in the TDFs reconstruction. We observed a concordance of 78% with the primary vegetation map and a prediction of 98% of independent locality records. Although PCA and DA tests explained 75.78% and 97.9%of variance observed, respectively, we observed an important overlap among the TDFs with other adjacent ecosystems, confirming the existence of transition zones among them. We successfully modeled the distribution of Mexican TDFs using a number of bioclimatic variables and co-distributed species. This autoecological niche approach suggests the necessity of rethinking the delimitations of ecosystems based on the recognition of transition zones among them in order to understand the real nature of communities and association patterns of species.},
