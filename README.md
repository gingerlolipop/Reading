# Reading

This repository stores the .bib files to publications I read for my thesis. Each chapter has its own file. 
There are also a few classical papers I read for the class BIOL548J, which are also referred to when I wrote my thesis proposal. However, they are not duplicated to the chapter-specific sections.
